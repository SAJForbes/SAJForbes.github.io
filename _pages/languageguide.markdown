## About me

I am a learner who moderates the r/languagelearning community on Reddit. I have spent a lot of time learning languages, learning how to learn them, and searching the web for answers to common questions. Over that time, I've gained a lot of insight into what a beginner needs to start. That's what I'm aiming to share with you here.

## How this guide works

The purpose of this guide is to prepare you with the skills and knowledge you need to learn a language. It takes the best of what the world has to offer about language learning and condenses it into a guide that is practicable, insightful, and easy to understand. It will not give you a special, perfect technique to learn a language (such a thing doesn’t exist), nor am I going to talk about what I do personally.

This guide is structured to take you from the absolute beginner stages through to an upper-intermediate level, with a focus on placing the most important information at the start, and leaving the extra info for later. This means you don't need to read the full guide before you begin learning. If you're an absolute beginner, I recommend you read at least until the end of [Building a Method](\assets\docs\languageguide\method\), but you can begin your journey once you've read the chapter on resources.

Though it might seem like a lot of info, I advise you to think of this guide as an investment. If you start with a bit of theory now, you will save time in the long run by doing it better the first time.


## Principles

Principles are the basic underlying rules and ideas that enable you to be an effective language learner. If there is something I want to highlight as a principle, you will find it in a blue box as seen below. I advise you to pay attention to them.[^1]

[^1]: Many principles you will sometimes hear called "language hacks" elsewhere online, though this is somewhat of a misnomer. Elaboration can be found in the section [Why is the term "language hacks" a misnomer?](\assets\docs\languageguide\appendixe\#why-is-the-term-language-hacks-a-misnomer)

**Principle: Example**

I’ve scattered most of the principles throughout the guide to prevent
you from getting overloaded. While a principle may be placed under a
certain section where it is most relevant, it will also apply to other
aspects of your learning.
