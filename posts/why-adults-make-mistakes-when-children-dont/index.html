    <section class="post-content">
      <p>Let me introduce you to an often-posed question in the language learning community: Why do children seem to have a natural ability to learn languages perfectly that adults lack? Are their brains inherently better at language learning than us adults, or are they better positioned to take advantage of a natural ability we all possess?</p>
<p>Wherever you fall, most people tend to say the answer is something in-between.</p>
<p>While I can&rsquo;t discount that children have some natural advantages due to their age, in this post I&rsquo;m going to argue that it&rsquo;s their environment rather than innate talent that lets children learn to such a high level, and we can take advantage of this to inform how we learn.</p>
<h2 id="mistakes-and-errors">Mistakes and errors</h2>
<p>First we need to mark an important distinction between mistakes and errors.</p>
<p><em>Mistakes</em> are accidental, and the learner knows they are wrong. Mistakes are a natural part of speaking and disappear over time with practice.</p>
<p><em>Errors</em> are made due to a learner&rsquo;s lack of knowledge. Errors are much more difficult to fix.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not mistakes we should be concerned about, but in fact errors that are the true culprit.</p>
<h2 id="why-adults-make-errors">Why adults make errors</h2>
<p>There are two general sources of errors:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The learner&rsquo;s native language interferes with the process of using the target language</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The learner misuses a rule or word they learned because they lack experience</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike adults, children do not make the first type of error, even when they are learning multiple languages.</p>
<p>Any types of errors the learner makes can fossilise though repeated use, a common learner problem. To help us understand why this happens, we will employ an analogy:</p>
<h3 id="the-garden-path">The Garden Path</h3>
<p>Think of your native language as a large garden path, with thousands of crossroads everywhere. Each path is a word or bit of grammar. A crossroad is like a point where you could use one of many different words or grammatical forms, and the branching paths are those words or forms that are correct in that context. Language works by the speaker following this path to reach a destination&mdash;their intended meaning.</p>
<p><img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1601233204581-229f503a9a66?ixlib=rb-1.2.1&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjEyMDd9&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=crop&amp;w=1489&amp;q=80" alt="Path"> <em>This part of the path leads to the sentence, &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you have picked a simpler analogy?&quot;</em></p>
<p>Learning a language is like building a new set of paths. Gradually building knowledge of your target language would be like building a set of signs to help you navigate these new paths in your garden. You gradually improve the state of the signs and paths through practice. Reading and listening is like watching other people walk your garden, and speaking and writing is like walking it yourself.</p>
<p>Using this analogy, we can see how errors arise.</p>
<p>The first reason learners tend to make errors is they <strong>superimpose the structure and logic of their native language over that of their target language</strong>. When you use a language the first time, most of the paths are incomplete or missing. Even if your vocabulary is up to the task&mdash;you can see the crossroads you need to get to&mdash;your grammar knowledge can be incomplete, meaning you&rsquo;re not sure which paths to follow to get there. The result is that learners often unconsciously follow the nice, clear signs and paths of their native language. Without enough experience, it can be hard to know which paths native speakers prefer. The clearer the path of your native language, the harder it can be to see the one you&rsquo;re supposed to be taking.</p>
<p>The second kind of error occurs when <strong>learners apply rules incorrectly or incompletely</strong>. We already have our native language well integrated into our manner of thought, and as a result it is very difficult to break away from using those structures to build new ones. To help us we often use teachers and other resources to quickly build artificial paths we can use early on. Language paths are so complex that, even when you have a teacher or resource to explain how the language works, the path you build won&rsquo;t exactly resemble the one taken by natives.</p>
<p>The goal of the adult learner is generally to find <em>some way</em> to be understood. Even though they are inexperienced, they will generally take any path available to them in the hopes of being understood, even if they have never seen a native speaker walk that path before. With both kinds of errors you will get to the end of the path&mdash;people will probably understand you&mdash;but you won&rsquo;t sound like a native.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-about-children">So what about children?</h2>
<p>Children have literally no other reference&mdash;no well-trodden paths or clear signposts&mdash;to use in their language. They have no choice but to build one from scratch, watching their parents tread through their garden and following. Building your garden is much harder work than modifying it, but building it from scratch means you don&rsquo;t have any template to follow except the one given to you by the people surrounding you. It is unlikely someone would make the same kind of errors typical of adult learners in that context.</p>
<p>At their core, languages are memory. Children build paths with thousands of hours of input. When they first speak, they scarcely innovate at all, just repeating forms and words they have heard hundreds of times as they remember them. The paths and signs they are following have been well-trodden by those around them.</p>
<p>At the same time, adult learners are not given the same opportunities for level-appropriate practice. Pay attention next time you see an adult interact with a young child. Often, questions posed by adults will be met with silence. This occurs as the child, not knowing how to express themselves, chooses to say nothing at all. Parents often subconsciously modify their questions into yes/no forms in order to reduce the communicative burden on the child. They generally don&rsquo;t extend the same courtesy to adult learners.</p>
<h2 id="so-what-should-the-adult-non-native-do">So what should the adult non-native do?</h2>
<p>The key insight of the garden path analogy is that if you want to learn to speak accurately, you need to see natives walk the path themselves.</p>
<p>What you should do depends on your goals.</p>
<p>Are you unconcerned about speaking perfectly, and only interested in getting from A to B? Quickly building your own imperfect paths is the best way to go. Ultimately, language is about successful communication. If any errors cause confusion, you can always focus on fixing just that path.</p>
<p>If you want to learn a language to a high level, the story is different. Instruction can help, but its true function should be to prepare you to see the other path that natives are treading. Once you see it, it will take hundreds of repetitions until the path is clear enough that you can tread it yourself comfortably.</p>
<p>Taken to its extreme, this argument suggests that anyone who aspires to speak at a very high level should avoid speaking or writing almost entirely to start, instead focusing on listening and reading. Any attempt at early speech will likely result in you following a path comprising a combination of the artificial  structures of language instruction and the well-trodden default paths of your native language. This happens as you hunt for words and constructions you know you know in your native language, then search for the target-language equivalent that you may not have fully mastered. Active study should consist of learning thousands of natural, common phrases over drilling single words or isolated grammatical forms. Passive study should be enjoyable, level appropriate content used in huge quantity, ideally with multiple repetitions of the same content to help you remember it. You should learn the most common constructions and forms and learn them well. When you practise speaking, you should generally stick to them, only forming more complex sentences much later on, once they are familiar to you from your input.</p>
<p>Many learners choose to solidify their paths by speaking and writing. This is a powerful tool&mdash;you quickly build the quality of your garden path by navigating it yourself. However, without correction, your errors will fossilise through repeated use. The more you use unfamiliar forms and words when you speak, the more you risk building and strengthening an unnatural path. The stronger a path gets, the harder it will be to fix later.</p>
<p>How far you take this conclusion depends on much you accept the premise. Keep in mind that children do plenty of writing and speaking, making errors all the time. In general, however, they don&rsquo;t try to do as much as fast as an adult learner. They also have a lot more input and repetition.</p>
<p>This does not suggest a dichotomy&mdash;you can start by walking the artificially built paths, using the language as you were taught, then later going back to spot where you went wrong. It might be you find this middle ground a lot more satisfying, letting you build friendships and have interesting conversations far quicker than a child could. What this does suggest, however, is that there are trade-offs to be made by studying grammar, drilling single words, and speaking a lot early on.</p>
