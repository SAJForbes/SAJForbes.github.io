These days it seems like there are thousands of different language learning methods out there. Which one are we supposed to pick? Do you even need a method? With this post, I am hoping to clear up what a method actually is and if there is any benefit to using one.

#What is a method?

The number things that get called a language learning method is very wide. At its core, a method is just a set of activities to help you learn a language. In addition, a method will often include many other aspects such as hints, routines, and approaches.

There seems to be so many different methods

The quantity and variety can become quite bewildering. My hope is to help you sort out what is going on so the landscape of methods looks a lot less confusing. What I hope to demonstrate is that most methods are only made specific to give them the illusion of being somehow optimised or scientific, and are in fact comprised of the fundamentally the same pieces, which are simply swapped out until it looks sufficiently different from other methods. There is no fundamentally different method and there is no perfect method.

Once you realise this, it becomes easy to pick it apart

To see that, all we need to
