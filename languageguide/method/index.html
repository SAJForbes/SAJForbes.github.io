        <p>A method is the combination of resources and exercises you use to learn a language. As a beginner, your goal is to build the skills you need to reach an intermediate level as outlined in <a href="/languageguide/beforeyoustart/#what-you-will-learn">What you will learn</a> as fast as possible.</p>

<p>In this chapter I will provide an overview of how to build a method of your own.</p>

<h1 id="the-four-keys-of-an-effective-method">The four keys of an effective method</h1>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no specific method that stands out as the best for me to outline for you, though some are more effective than others. Instead, individual preference and interest seem to be better predictors of success.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> All of this means I can’t simply outline a good method for you to follow. You have a lot of flexibility, and how you personally respond to different exercises and resources should dictate how you adjust your method. To help get you started, this section discusses the four key elements common to all good methods. These are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Goal-focus</li>
  <li>Structure</li>
  <li>Drill key skills</li>
  <li>Practise your language</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="goal-focus">Goal-focus</h2>

<p>Having a goal and properly striving towards it is one of the most important facets of an effective method. We will begin this section with the key principle, then I will explain how to execute it.</p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Principle: Work towards your goals</strong>
<br />
One of the best things you can do for your progress is to focus on your goals and the skills you need to get there. This will help you stay motivated and ensure that what you are doing is aligned to what you want out of your language. Spend time considering your goals, then work towards them relentlessly.</p>

<p>This first component of goal-focus is to <strong>have a goal or set of goals</strong>. These are key for retaining motivation. If you don’t have a goal, head back to the start of this guide and ensure you do.</p>

<p>The second component is to <strong>work towards your goals by actively studying the skills and vocabulary you need for your goal.</strong> This will be covered in the section <a href="/languageguide/method/#drill-key-skills">Drill key skills</a> below.</p>

<p>The final component is to <strong>seek out and directly practise situations involving your goals</strong>. This will be covered in the section <a href="/languageguide/method/#practise-your-language">Practise your language</a> below.</p>

<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>

<p>Structure in language learning is crucial. There are three sub-elements to this: Build a base, push yourself, and balance. Two of these are so crucial they are key principles, so pay attention to them!</p>

<h3 id="build-a-base">Build a base</h3>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Principle: Build a base and work up</strong>
<br />
Begin with the simplest and most beginner-friendly components of your language, then gradually build towards more advanced ones as you progress. Focus on the components that help you improve the most. Without a base level of understanding, it will be harder to understand and learn more advanced concepts or comprehend content that uses them.</p>

<p>Unless something really interests you, I recommend you avoid jumping too far ahead and learning nuanced grammar points or advanced vocabulary when there are plenty of more applicable aspects of your language to learn. You will get far more mileage from the basic stuff.</p>

<p>Courses are highly recommended in-part because they provide all the structure you need to build a comprehensive foundation in the language. If any aspect of your learning required for you to achieve your goals is not well-covered by your beginner course, you should seek to learn it separately.</p>

<h3 id="push-yourself">Push yourself</h3>

<p>The second sub-component of structure is pushing yourself and is an important technique to avoid your progress stagnating. This sub-component is also our next principle:</p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Principle: Push yourself</strong>
<br />
During your study, you will inevitably find certain resources or content eventually
become easy for you. The key to a good method is that you move on as
soon as you begin to feel too comfortable with a resource. There will
always be something more challenging for you to try. By continually
challenging yourself, you will be constantly pushed to improve.</p>

<p>This applies to everything you use, including course materials, content, and flashcards.</p>

<h3 id="balance">Balance</h3>

<p>Balance means your learning has an appropriate balance of vocabulary, grammar, and the four skills. Spread your time out among the different aspects of your language. Learning a bit of vocabulary will aid your learning of grammar and vice versa. While you should focus on those skills most important to your goal, don’t neglect the others altogether.</p>

<h2 id="drill-key-skills">Drill key skills</h2>

<p>A drill is an exercise that isolates a single aspect of your language so that you can develop it separately from the others. Your method should incorporate drills where you have weaknesses, often caused by your course neglecting certain aspects of your language. There are many examples, including flashcards, practising pronunciation, and writing word forms.</p>

<p>The key drill I recommend using is flashcards. We will discuss flashcards later <a href="/languageguide/usingresourceseffectively/#using-flashcards-effectively">here</a>. Later, as you improve, I recommend you move to drilling with content. This is covered in the guide <a href="/languageguide/keyactivities/#drill-your-language-using-content">here</a>. We will look at a larger list of drills later <a href="/languageguide/whattostudy/#language-learning-activities">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="practise-your-language">Practise your language</h2>

<p>Practising your language integrates everything you have learned together. Examples include speaking with people, writing texts, or reading stories. It is usually less prevalent during the beginner stages, but will gradually take a larger role as you progress. Without practice, all of the knowledge and skills you build through your study will not translate into real-world language ability.</p>

<p>The best type of practice is <em>direct practice</em><sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, which means your practice time should be spent directly doing whatever your goal is. If your goal is to speak your language, your practice should involve talking to native speakers as much as possible.</p>

<p><strong>Ensure you spend plenty of time using content</strong>—it is crucial to progressing in your language. Many intermediate learners spend up to 75% of their time practising with input. Ideally, the course you use should rely heavily on content. Avoid spending less than one third of your time with content. Progress through input can be hard to notice in the short-term, but is invaluable long-term.</p>

<p>A helpful activity, extensive reading, will be covered later <a href="/languageguide/keyactivities/#extensive-reading">here</a> with more advice <a href="/languageguide/usingresourceseffectively/#using-input-effectively">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="combining-drill-and-practice">Combining drill and practice</h2>

<p>While drilling alone can be immensely beneficial, these individual skills will not automatically translate into ability with whatever situations your goal involves (such as speaking with people). Similarly, practice can be very powerful, but you will likely progress slower than you might otherwise without time spent working on your weaknesses.</p>

<p>The optimal method balances the two. As a part of your direct practice, you should base your drills off the weaknesses you discover through your language practice, focusing on those which are holding you back from doing the practice at a higher level. For example, imagine you practise through conversation, but find yourself only understanding once your interlocutor repeats themselves more slowly. Your next study session could utilise a podcast episode in which you repeatedly listen to specific parts until you can make out the words, only using a transcript where strictly necessary. This would help you build listening comprehension for fast speech that lets your next conversation practice progress with less hinderance.</p>

<h1 id="using-other-learners-methods">Using other learners’ methods</h1>

<p>I recommend you find some ideas for your method while you search for resources. There are plenty of places on the internet where people have detailed their own method. You can often find these with a simple Google search along the lines of “How to learn Japanese”. Take the useful bits of other people’s methods you find. Remember: the specifics of any method aren’t the key, so don’t stress about following someone’s method exactly.</p>

<p>Beware: there are a lot of cookie-cutter, search-engine-optimised, low-effort guides out there. It’s not a universal rule, but my general experience is that better guides are often written by individuals on their own websites or on language learning communities.</p>

<p>Using others’ methods is useful for two reasons. First, they will often give good resource recommendations and advice on integrating them into your method, which I can’t give you here. Second, you will often find good advice on your specific language, such as common beginner pitfalls or useful areas to focus your attention.</p>

<h1 id="turning-everything-into-a-method">Turning everything into a method</h1>

<p>This section is to help illustrate what your method might look like.</p>

<p>To summarise the guide so far, we have three kinds of resources: courses, flashcards, and input, and we need to turn it into a method that is goal-focused, structured, builds key skills, and involves language practice.</p>

<p>If you’ve followed the basic resource examples or found something similar, the method and resources should hopefully map on to each other quite well. If you’ve decided to use something a bit different, don’t worry! Simply check your method against the four elements to make sure you’re applying them all.</p>

<h2 id="where-to-spend-your-time">Where to spend your time</h2>

<p>How much time you spend with each resource will change over time depending on your level, the particular resources you find, and your goals.</p>

<p>Your level: At the beginning, your level is generally too low to gain much benefit from content. You first need to create a base for yourself. <strong>Learners generally progress from a point of mostly just using their course with some supplementary drilling, later transitioning to spending almost all of their time with content</strong>.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>Your resources: Different courses often emphasise different skills, which will create relative weaknesses in other areas. For example, if your course uses little content and focuses on exercises, you have a greater need to supplement your learning with content.</p>

<p>Your goals: Different goals naturally lend themselves to different skillsets and vocabulary. If you need to communicate in the near-term, you should be drilling key skills (speaking and listening) much more and earlier. If you are learning for business, you could seek out and drill business vocabulary, or otherwise find business-related content.</p>

<p>To help illustrate all this more clearly, the next section shows you a typical progression, but keep in mind how you will differ.</p>

<h2 id="a-typical-method">A typical method</h2>

<p>Here is how you might spend your time at the start:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Spend most of your time progressing through your beginner course to learn vocabulary and grammar</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spend a bit of time on the side drilling vocabulary using flashcards</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn the skills you need for your goal through your beginner course or a supplementary resource if necessary; focus heavily on learning the writing system if it is different</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Then, as you become more comfortable with the language, you begin reading and/or listening with some beginner-centred input.</p>

<p>After some time, once they know around 800 words, the basic grammar, and the basics of the four skills, most learners’ method change a bit. How yours changes will depend on your goals.</p>

<p>Intermediate learners:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>usually focus more on activities to build ability with the skills they need to meet their goals, using supplemental resources if necessary</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>usually begin to read, watch, or listen to intermediate-level content, whatever they personally enjoy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>usually begin speaking with native speakers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sometimes focus more on building their vocabulary every day using flashcards extensively</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>sometimes practise with a personal tutor, getting feedback on your weaknesses</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="other-options-for-activities">Other options for activities</h3>

<p>There are lots other ways to structure your method while following the three key requirements. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You could forego courses in favour of reading lots, looking up concepts as necessary</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You could drill by using a vocabulary list or writing sentences instead of flashcards<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">4</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your source of input could be mostly practising speaking with a friend or tutor rather than books or videos</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You could focus heavily on learning mostly through traditional classes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These are all valid choices for the right learner.</p>

<h2 id="milestones">Milestones</h2>

<p>In addition to your goals, you should have a set of intermediate-level milestones you are looking to achieve. What you consider success is determined by what your goal is, so here I will simply give you an indication of the kind of ability a good intermediate learner has.</p>

<p>A typical intermediate learner:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>knows over 2,000 Words, but aim to know about 3,000 and don’t stop there</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is fairly good at the skills most important for achieving their goals</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>is able to make it through a conversation with a native speaker, as long as they are accommodating</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>can understand learner-centred content, though native-level content will still be confusing</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>has a good grasp of the language’s grammar, though is far from comfortable with all of it</p>
  </li>
</ul>
