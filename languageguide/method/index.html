        <p>A method is the combination of resources and exercises you use to learn a language. As a beginner, your goal is to build the skills you need to reach an intermediate level as outlined in <a href="/languageguide/beforeyoustart/#what-you-will-learn">What you will learn</a> as fast as possible. Methods can be simple or complex, but regardless of how much effort you put into it, you will need one.</p>

<p>In this chapter I will provide an overview of how to build a method of your own.</p>

<h1 id="the-three-keys-of-an-effective-method">The three keys of an effective method</h1>

<p>Unfortunately, there is no single best language method.<sup id="fnref:3" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> There are
many highly effective methods and the specifics are not hugely
important. Individual preference and interest will play a strong role in
what works for you. Because of this, there is a lot of flexibility to
how you build your method, meaning I can only give you general advice.
To do that, this section shows you the three key elements common to all good methods. These are:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Structure</li>
  <li>Drill key skills</li>
  <li>Practise your language</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>

<p>Structure means you have an appropriate balance of vocabulary, grammar, and the four skills and learn the components of these in a good order.</p>

<p>Spread your time out among the different aspects of your language. Learning a bit of vocabulary will aid your learning of grammar and vice versa. Remember to build the skills to necessary to read, write, listen, or speak, depending on what your goal is. More advice on learning the four skills will be given later <a href="/languageguide/howtolearn/#the-four-skills">here</a>.</p>

<p>Though there is a some variation, there is a natural order to the knowledge you acquire in language learning. This brings us to the next principle:</p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Principle: Build a base and work up</strong>
<br />
Languages are best learned by starting from simple concepts and words
and building towards more complicated ones as you improve, focusing on
the components that help you improve the most. Without a base level of
understanding, it will be harder to understand more advanced concepts or
comprehend content that uses them.
<br />
Focus on learning the simplest thing you need to improve to get you
towards your goal. You will find you progress much faster.</p>

<p>Unless something really interests you, I recommend you avoid jumping too far ahead and learning nuanced grammar points or advanced vocabulary when there are plenty of more applicable aspects of your language to learn. You will get far more mileage from the basic stuff.</p>

<p>Courses are highly recommended in part because they provide all the structure you need to build a comprehensive foundation in the language. If any aspect of your learning required for you to achieve your goals is not well-covered by your beginner course, you should seek to learn it separately.</p>

<h2 id="drill-key-skills">Drill key skills</h2>

<p>A drill is an exercise that isolates a single aspect of your language so that you can develop it separately from the others. Your method should incorporate extra drills where you have weaknesses, often caused by your course neglecting certain aspects of your language.</p>

<p>The key drill I recommend is using flashcards. We will discuss flashcards later <a href="/languageguide/usingresourceseffectively/#using-flashcards-effectively">here</a>. Later, as you improve, I recommend you move to drilling with content. This is covered in the guide <a href="/languageguide/keyactivities/#drill-your-language-using-content">here</a>. We will look at a larger list of drills later <a href="/languageguide/whattostudy/#language-learning-activities">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="practise-your-language">Practise your language</h2>

<p>Practising your language integrates everything you have learned together. Examples include speaking with people, writing texts, or reading stories. It is mostly absent from the beginner stages, but will gradually take a larger role as you progress. Without practice, all of the knowledge and skills you build through your study will not translate into real-world language ability.</p>

<p>A helpful activity, extensive reading, will be covered later <a href="/languageguide/keyactivities/#extensive-reading">here</a> with more advice <a href="/languageguide/usingresourceseffectively/#using-input-effectively">here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="how-you-progress">How you progress</h1>

<p>Your method can be split into two phases: the <strong>starting phase</strong> and the
<strong>input phase</strong>. There is no concrete point where you exit one phase and begin the next.
These phases blend as you gradually build the knowledge you need to use more
natural content.</p>

<p>The <strong>starting phase</strong> is where you focus on building the skills
necessary to begin using input to learn your language. In this phase,
your level is too low to understand much content, so you first need to
drill basic grammar and vocabulary to create a base for yourself. There
is nothing stopping you using content here; you’d simply have to spend
most of your time with a dictionary and grammar resource, which is not
particularly efficient or fun.</p>

<p>At this stage your goals are relatively simple:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Learn your first ~800 words</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn the basic grammar</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn the basics of the four skills; focus heavily on the writing system if it is different</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>The <strong>input phase</strong> comes next. This is the rest of your study. Once you
have the basics down, you can take advantage of that base to begin
learning with content.</p>

<p>At this stage your goals are more directed by your reasons for learning the language. Here are the ones common to all learners:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Continue to build your grammar ability</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep learning lots more words—an intermediate learner knows over 2,000, but aim to know about 3,000 and don’t stop there</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Build your ability with the skills you need to meet your goals, focus on integrating them into your grammar and vocabulary knowledge</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Transition into using content intended for native speakers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="building-your-method">Building your method</h1>

<p>There are thousands of possible methods, but a very common and effective way of achieving the above progression is by studying with the resources outlined previously. Next I will give you some key recommended activities for the two stages. Remember that these are just recommendations. You can ignore this in favour of somebody else’s guide or substitute individual activities out for others. They key is that you continue to <strong>build your language ability</strong> by following the three keys: ensure your learning has <strong>structure</strong>, you are <strong>drilling key skills</strong>, and are <strong>practising your language</strong>. This will let you succeed with any method.</p>

<p>To begin with, I recommend you don’t overthink it. Start basic, try things out and see what works for you.</p>

<h2 id="starting-phase">Starting phase</h2>

<p><strong>Key activities:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Progress through your beginner course to learn vocabulary and grammar</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Drill vocabulary (or grammar) using flashcards</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learn the skills you need for your goal through your beginner course
or a supplementary resource if necessary</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Once you are at the end of the starting phase, begin reading and/or listening as much as you can using beginner input</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="input-phase">Input phase</h2>

<p>Because the input phase is so long, and the number of possible activities so large, I can’t provide you with specific activities or goals, but general ones suitable for an intermediate learner. Exactly what goals you choose and what you learn will be dictated by your goals and interests.</p>

<p><strong>Key activities:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Continue to study with your course</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use any supplemental resources to help you learn skills not well covered by your beginner course</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read, watch, or listen to whatever content you enjoy</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Keep using flashcards every day if you find them helpful</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Practice your language with a personal tutor, get feedback on your weaknesses</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Begin speaking with native speakers</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Do the activities in the <a href="/languageguide/keyactivities/">Key Activities</a> chapter</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Begin using content intended for native speakers</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="other-options-for-activities">Other options for activities</h2>

<p>There are lots other ways to structure your method while following the three key requirements. For example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>You could forego courses in favour of reading lots, looking up concepts as necessary</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You could drill by using a vocabulary list or writing sentences instead of flashcards<sup id="fnref:5" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Your source of input could be mostly practising speaking with a friend or tutor</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You could focus heavily on learning mostly through traditional classes</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>These are all valid choices for the right learner.</p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Principle: Work towards your goals</strong>
<br />
One of the best things you can do for your progress is to focus on your
goals and the skills you need to get there. Unfortunately, the
individual skills improved by studying do not easily translate into your
target situation. This means you need to improve through <em>direct
practice</em>, spending time directly practising the thing you want to
become good at.<sup id="fnref:4" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup> For example, if you want to converse face-to-face,
you need to spend a large amount of time practising speaking and
listening, ideally in communication with others. Keep this in mind as you build your method.</p>

<h2 id="using-other-learners-methods">Using other learners’ methods</h2>

<p>I recommend you find some ideas for your method while you search for resources. There are plenty of places on the internet where people have detailed their own method. You can often find these with a simple Google search along the lines of “How to learn Japanese”. Take the useful bits of other people’s methods you find. Remember: the specifics of any method aren’t the key, so don’t stress about following someone’s method exactly.</p>

<p>Using others’ methods is useful for two reasons. First, they will often give good resource recommendations and advice on integrating them into your method, which I can’t give you here. Second, you will often find good advice on your specific language, such as common beginner pitfalls or useful areas to focus your attention.</p>

<p>Beware: Common learner advice often fails to account for learner goals, and some exercises may be poorly optimised for your goals. For example, if you learn Chinese, you may be recommended to learn the Hanzi (characters) by writing them out repeatedly. This is very effective at enabling you to write and use a few Hanzi very well. It is also very time-consuming. However, if you goal is to speak or read lots of content, this could be a misuse of your time. That same amount of time could be spent learning to recognise even more Hanzi or practising pronunciation. Remember the principle <em>Build a base and work up</em>? If, later on, you want to master writing, you will find the task much easier with a strong base from your reading.</p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Principle: Push yourself</strong>
<br />
During your study, you will inevitably find certain resources or content eventually
become easy for you. The key to a good method is that you move on as
soon as you begin to feel to comfortable with a resource. There will
always be something more challenging for you to try. By continually
challenging yourself, you will be constantly pushed to improve.</p>

<h2 id="splitting-your-time">Splitting your time</h2>

<p>There’s no single guideline for how to split your time. At the beginner
stages, it is common for learners to spend fully half or more of their
time with their preferred beginner course, with the other half spent
drilling and practising in equal measure. Later on, time with the course
tends to reduce and practice tends to become more frequent. Do what
works for you. The key is that you progress and improve.</p>

<p>You will need to adjust how you spend your time based on the nature of
the course you are using. For example, if your course uses little
content and focuses on exercises, you have a greater need to supplement
your learning with content.</p>

<p><strong>Your most important time is that which you spend with content</strong>—it is
crucial to progressing in your language. Many learners spend up to 75%
of their time practising with input. Apart from at the very beginning,
avoid reducing your time below one third. Progress through input can be
hard to notice in the short-term, but is invaluable long-term.</p>
