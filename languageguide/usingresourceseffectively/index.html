        <p>The purpose of this chapter is to help improve your method using the
core resources from the earlier chapter on finding resources. We will
cover how to use your course, flashcards, content, and dictionary.</p>

<h1 id="using-your-course-effectively">Using your course effectively</h1>

<p>The purpose of a course is to introduce you to basic grammar and
vocabulary using phrases, explanations, exercises, dialogues, or
whatever method is preferred by your chosen course.</p>

<p>There is one universal rule: Don’t try to memorise your lesson content.
Using a language is not the same as being able to remember all of the
rules and exceptions. Notice that you speak your native language
perfectly well, but would struggle to talk about the grammatical rules
you are applying. The same applies to your target language. Languages
must be acquired, not memorised.</p>

<p>There are many learners who prefer to skim through workbooks or online
resources to get a broad understanding before using content. Focusing
hard and spending a large amount of time trying to learn well during
your course is not mandatory.</p>

<p>You may also like to make a workbook. Many people make their own
workbook and write down everything they learn. This is a time-consuming
process you may find slower than simply using content; however, the
choice is yours.</p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Principle: Don’t try to learn things perfectly the first time you encounter them</strong>
<br />
Learning happens slowly over time, usually well after you are first
introduced to a word or concept. You don’t need a perfect understanding
of one lesson before you begin the next. The very act of moving forward
with a loose understanding will help teach you things already covered as
you encounter them again.</p>

<h2 id="when-to-stop-using-a-beginner-course">When to stop using a beginner course</h2>

<p>You can move on once your course finishes or you have dealt with the
core grammar, such as verb conjugations and noun declensions, articles,
and prepositions. This occurs faster with languages more similar to your
native language. After that point, it helps to use your course or some
other book or website as a reference of forms to take note of when you
are using content.</p>

<p>It is helpful to finish your course. This will give you a wider
knowledge base that will let you recognise forms you might miss
otherwise.</p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Principle: Repetition</strong>
<br />
Words and grammatical forms will be apprehended only once your brain is exposed to them enough
times.
<br />
There are three main ways learners get repetition. First, content
provides natural repetition as the most common words and forms are
encountered frequently in context. Second, drills such as flashcards
that are designed to repeatedly prompt you until you remember. Finally,
you can consciously repeat the same piece of content multiple times or
review past lessons.
<br />
The best repetition follows the principle of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaced_repetition">spaced
repetition</a>, where
reviews are done just before the learner forgets. Try to encounter new
words or forms again soon after you first learn them.</p>

<h1 id="using-flashcards-effectively">Using flashcards effectively</h1>

<p>Those who emphasise learning lots of words via flashcards usually
recommend doing so for the purpose of enabling you to quickly move on to
using content. Keep this in mind if you end up using flashcards heavily.
They are still a drill and a supplement—their purpose is to aid your use
of the language, not as an end goal in of itself.</p>

<p>Here are a few good tips for you to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Don’t learn too many new words at once—you will be fine to start,
but reviews will quickly overwhelm you</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Try to study consistently every day</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Make your own cards of words you want to learn</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Delete or suspend cards that aren’t working for you for any
reason—you can always learn it later</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use phrases—I will cover this soon</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you use Anki, tweak the settings a bit—you can use <a href="https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-1/a/anki-setup/#Recommended-Options-Settings">this
guide</a>
to start</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="flashcard-review">Flashcard review</h2>

<p>There are three ways you can review your cards:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Prompt with native language, answer with target language
(productive learning)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Prompt with target language, answer with native language
(receptive learning)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A combination of both</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Productive learning means you are trying to <em>produce</em> your target
language. Productive learning is the more difficult of the two, and card
review is generally slower as a result. On the positive side, productive
learning is great for forcing your mind to absorb a word or phrase
properly, meaning you tend to learn more thoroughly and in a way that
lets you begin using that knowledge sooner.</p>

<p>Receptive learning means you are simply being repeatedly exposed to
words or phrases in your target language and asked to recall their
meaning. This method is faster, but generally helps much more with
understanding than it does producing your target language. This can be
great for getting you using content quickly.</p>

<p>I recommend a combination of both, based on your needs. What you do
should be determined by your goals. Some words you might need to be
using soon, so you might practise them productively. Others might just
be helpful for understanding, but not something you expect to need soon,
so you’d practise them receptively.</p>

<p class="notice--danger"><strong>Key tip: Aim to get about 90 percent of your cards correct</strong>
<br />
As I have noted, flashcards utilise the forgetting curve to try to
prompt you with a word just before you forget it. You will begin to
notice that this doesn’t always work perfectly. Sometimes you will have
already forgotten a word, forcing you to relearn it, but other times you
will get the answer easily. While you can improve your retention by
setting Anki to show you your cards more often, this has the effect of
slowing down your study, as you will see cards you know comfortably far
too often. Conversely, if you set Anki to show you cards less often, you
may find yourself forgetting lots of words before you see them again.
The best spot sits in the middle. Aim to “strategically forget” about 10
percent of your cards. In the long run this will save you time.</p>

<h2 id="phrases">Phrases</h2>

<p>While you can learn words on their own, <strong>I recommend you use phrases</strong>.
Learning phrases with their translation is useful for lots of reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>They can teach you key phrases for early communication or travelling</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They help you use more complex but common constructions earlier in
your learning</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They provide insight into how the language is used</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They provide context for how words are used and what other words
tend to be used with them</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They can teach you grammar by forcing you to absorb certain forms</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>They give you passive exposure to other words, cementing them in
your mind</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>There are a few ways you might engage with phrases in your flashcards.
These depend on, firstly, if you are learning productively or
receptively, and secondly, if you are trying to learn a word with the
phrase in support or the whole phrase itself. This creates the below
quadrant:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th style="text-align: left"><strong>Card Form</strong></th>
      <th style="text-align: left"><strong>Productively</strong></th>
      <th style="text-align: left"><strong>Receptively</strong></th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left"><strong>Word + phrase</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Learn word productively</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Learn word’s usage, phrase provides context</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td style="text-align: left"><strong>Phrase only</strong></td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Learn full phrase productively</td>
      <td style="text-align: left">Repeated exposure to phrase</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

<p>Anki also allows for
<a href="https://docs.ankiweb.net/editing.html#cloze-deletion">cloze-deletion</a>,
a popular method that shows a phrase with a word or words hidden.</p>

<p>When you use phrases receptively, you are generating repeated exposure.
This is great for giving you context for a words usage, but you are
unlikely to remember the phrase well.</p>

<p>Using phrases productively is beneficial for building a strong recall of
the phrase in its entirety, which is useful when you want to remember a
construction so you can use it yourself, but less useful for vocabulary.
Because it can be so hard, I recommend you use this with phrases you
already mostly understand. You may choose to highlight the word or
construction you are interested in.</p>

<p>It is common for learners to begin with essential phrases such as “how
do you say…”. These are very useful for understanding how native
speakers express themselves and will help you a lot when first
communicating. These are usually learned productively.</p>

<p>Because of this, I recommend a combination: learn words receptively with
an example phrase to quickly improve your vocabulary and help you read
and listen; learn phrases productively with a word or construction
highlighted to absorb the usage of the language. Focus on words and
forms you need to use soon.</p>

<p class="notice--danger"><strong>Key tip: Keep your phrases simple</strong>
<br />
Learning something new takes focused effort, so you can only really memorise one thing at a time.
Start very simple and build off that base as you come to understand more
of the language. Don’t use long phrases or multi-sentence phrases.
<br />
Ideally, your flashcards should contain no more than one new word and
one unfamiliar grammatical form. If you have lots of information you
want to learn, split it into multiple cards.</p>

<h2 id="make-your-own-flashcards">Make your own flashcards</h2>

<p>The best way to use flashcards is by creating your own. If you find
vocabulary that you want to know and use sentences that you have chosen,
learning them becomes easier as you are more motivated and pay closer
attention to what you are learning. If you use Anki, use the
documentation. There is also a helpful video
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bJFw9gBkvcY&amp;t=356s">here</a>.</p>

<h1 id="using-input-effectively">Using input effectively</h1>

<p>Here is the key rule: It takes a lot of exposure to get comfortable
using the language, so try to use as much content as you can in your
study.</p>

<p>How you use input depends a lot on what you are doing. There are two
broad types of activity: those in which you sit and focus with a
difficult piece of content in order to learn something new (active
learning), and those in which you simply use content for enjoyment
without focused study (passive learning). You will do both during your
study. Content used for passive learning tends to be easier.</p>

<p>No matter how you use it, the key to input is that you try to understand
as much as possible.</p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Principle: Engage your memory</strong>
<br />
One key to effective learning is by actively using your memory during the
learning process. This means, as much as possible, try to actively
recall the meaning of words and forms you encounter. Don’t just
passively read or instantly turn to a dictionary or textbook for
answers. Flashcards are built on this principle by forcing you to
attempt to recall a word’s definition before you can see the answer.</p>

<p class="notice--danger"><strong>Key tip: Repeat the same content multiple times</strong>
<br />
Repetition is important to learning. By re-using the same piece of
content, the words and forms you encounter there will be much more
likely to stick in your mind. The more you repeat it, the more
repetition you will get.</p>

<h2 id="what-input-should-i-use">What input should I use?</h2>

<p>This is covered further in the section <a href="/languageguide/howtolearn/#comprehensible-input">Comprehensible input</a></p>

<p>There are two key criteria:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>How interested you are in it</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How understandable it is</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>One way to ensure interest is to <strong>use content similar to what you
already find interesting in your native language.</strong> That is, do the
things you already enjoy doing, but using your target language instead.
This can be watching YouTube or TV shows, reading comic books, or even
gaming. As a beginner, finding good content can be hard, especially for
those learning rare languages. You may have to compromise and choose
something less interesting because it is closer to your level.</p>

<p>Your content should already be mostly understandable, meaning you
already understand 90–98% of it. This is the principle .</p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Principle: Your level +1</strong>
<br />
Learning occurs
when the brain struggles a bit before making a successful connection.
The best way to ensure this is to choose content that is your level +1.
+1 means that the content is <strong>just a little bit challenging</strong>. It is
difficult, but still comprehensible.
<br />
What precisely +1 means depends on what you are studying. An audio
recording with 100% known vocabulary counts as +1 if you struggle with
aural comprehension.
<br />
For more info, read and in the appendix.</p>

<h1 id="using-dictionaries-effectively">Using dictionaries effectively</h1>

<p>Dictionaries are key learning aide that are best used to get the meaning
of <strong>key unknown words</strong>.</p>

<p>More important than what you do is what you avoid doing. Here are four
key <strong>don’ts</strong>:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Don’t simply look up new words as you encounter them</strong>. First,
attempt to understand the sentence, then finish the section or text.
You are unlikely to remember the meaning of a word if you
immediately continue reading.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Don’t look up uncommon words when there are plenty of common ones
to learn</strong>. A large portion of the new words you encounter will only
appear once, meaning there will not be repeated opportunities to
help learn them.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Don’t blindly trust single-word translations</strong>. Translations are
imperfect. Languages use words differently. For example, the English
word “exercise” has two completely different meanings, one to do
with fitness and the other with study. A dictionary won’t know which
one you mean.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Don’t use dictionaries to learn words on their own</strong>. This can
cause you to learn less common words without being aware of their
proper usage.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="chapter-summary">Chapter summary</h1>

<p>Avoid memorising your lesson content or trying to learn your lessons
perfectly the first time. It is better to move on with an incomplete
understanding.</p>

<p>Flashcards are best used by prompting with both your target language and
your native language. This ensures you encounter words and forms in a
variety of ways. Make sure you use simple sentences with your
flashcards.</p>

<p>Input is best used in mass amounts. Use input that is already mostly
comprehensible.</p>

<p>Use dictionaries to search for key unknown words. Use it once you have
first attempted to understand the text you are using and have completed
the paragraph you encountered it in.</p>
