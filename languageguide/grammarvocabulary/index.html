        <p>In this section we’ll be looking at how to improve your acquisition of grammar and vocabulary.</p>

<h1 id="grammar">Grammar</h1>

<p>While it might seem like there is a lot of grammar to get your head
around, the core grammar of a language forms a kind of “hump” that, once
you get past it, opens the language up and enables progression with
greater ease. Once you’re done with the core grammar, you will probably
never have to approach it as systematically again.</p>

<p>Your initial grammar learning comes from your beginner course. This can
be supplemented by exercises such as sentence flashcards and exercises;
however, this should not be the majority of your time. Most of the grammar you will learn over time with input.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p class="notice--danger"><strong>Key tip: Do not rely on memorising grammar rules</strong>
<br />
In general, memorising rules is a poor way to acquire a language.
Learning only happens when you use the language. Rules and other aides
such as conjugation tables should be used as a stepping stone to help
you understand meaning in context.</p>

<p class="notice--danger"><strong>Key tip: Avoid spending all your time on grammar</strong>
<br />
While the noticeable progress feels good, you will learn faster overall
with the help of input and context supplementing your learning.
Languages are much more than grammar rules and you will not learn by
studying grammar in isolation.</p>

<h2 id="flashcard-phrases-for-grammar">Flashcard phrases for grammar</h2>

<p>Learners commonly experience difficulty remembering how to use grammar when first speaking, or simply struggle to remember how the rule works in context. For this, memorising phrases can be very powerful.</p>

<p>Grammar flashcards generally consist of a single sentence, as simple as
possible, that demonstrates the particular grammatical rule used in
context. This might be as simple as creating a set of cards for all the
verb conjugations, one for each type. It can be helpful to bold or
highlight the particular feature you want to focus on.</p>

<p>Productive learning is preferred over receptive because understanding grammar receptively is
generally too easy to do when you have context, especially for languages
closer to English.</p>

<p>I recommend you use phrases from your course or the internet to ensure
they are correct—grammar can be very easy to get wrong as a beginner.</p>

<h1 id="vocabulary">Vocabulary</h1>

<p>Vocabulary is generally the more underrated of the two core components.
A huge portion of speaking a language is really just knowing enough
words.</p>

<p>For a language like English, the number of words you’d need to be fluent
is over 10,000. Increasing your vocabulary is therefore always a useful
task when you don’t know what to study. While 10,000 is a large number,
you will get there eventually by chipping away at it every day.</p>

<p>Beginners typically learn vocabulary in three main ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Discovery: Words introduced through your beginner course</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Practice: Reading and listening</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Drill: Flashcards</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is rare that you will learn a word simply by having it introduced to
you once. Vocabulary is learned after repeated exposure, either in
content or with flashcards.</p>

<p class="notice--danger"><strong>Key tip: Prioritise words over grammar</strong>
<br />
Prioritise increasing your vocabulary over learning advanced grammar. In conversation,
advanced grammar can often easily be understood through context. This is
rarely true of unknown words, unless they happen to include roots or
affixes that are already familiar. If you’re not convinced,
take note of how often you struggle to understand the sense of what is
being said because of grammar versus vocabulary. Children passively understand far more words than adult learners by the
time they begin using more complex grammar, and this is for a good
reason. Not knowing the correct word is a far more common barrier than grammar.</p>

<h2 id="what-words-should-i-learn">What words should I learn?</h2>

<p>There are two primary criteria you should use. These are <strong>personal
relevance</strong> and <strong>frequency</strong>.</p>

<p>Learning words that are personally relevant to you is a good way to
ensure you are practising what you are learning. To meet this criterion,
the words you learn need to be <strong>appearing in your resources often</strong> or
be ones you think you will need to meet your goals.</p>

<p>Choosing words based on the frequency they appear in the language is
useful as they are the most likely to be useful to you in the future.
Words in natural language follow something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law">Zipf’s
Law</a>. This means that the
most common word will occur twice as often as the next most common word,
which will occur twice as often as the next most common, and so on. This
means languages are heavily dominated by the most common words. <strong>Once
you have learned 2,000–3,000 words, you have covered almost all the
words you will hear in daily conversation</strong>. With only a few hundred
words, you will have access to almost all the filler words, which make
up most of spoken language.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p class="notice--danger"><strong>Key tip: Don’t learn closely related words together</strong>
<br />
Although it might seem like a good idea, it’s best <strong>not</strong> to learn words together if they are related or in any way similar, as this can cause you to confuse them. This includes near synonyms (rely/depend), opposites (fast/slow), words typically recounted together (days of the week, numbers), or even similar-sounding words (delay/relay).
<br />
It is acceptable to learn words together that belong to a common theme (such as items in a kitchen), as this can help you build a story in your mind.</p>

<p class="notice--danger"><strong>Key tip: Learn numbers</strong>
<br />
Learning numbers, particularly large ones, can be a surprisingly difficult task, making dates an early challenge for many learners. It helps to spend focused effort learning them through drills. You may find <a href="https://langpractice.com/">LangPractice</a> helpful for this.</p>

<h2 id="word-lists">Word Lists</h2>

<p>You may find it helpful to keep a list of those words or phrases you
have looked up and find interesting enough to want to remember. This can
serve as a useful reference and the act of writing a list by hand can
aid memorisation. This is not mandatory.</p>

<p>Word lists should not simply be read over, but revised with one side
covered to get your memory working.</p>

<p>You can find more info on learning vocabulary in <a href="/languageguide/appendixc">Appendix C</a>.</p>

<h2 id="mnemonics">Mnemonics</h2>

<p>Mnemonics are versatile tool that turns vocabulary into easy-to-recall
mental images that help you remember a word. Mnemonics can be very
useful to learn vocabulary quickly; however, the word won’t be truly
learned until you don’t need the mnemonic and can use and understand the
word automatically. Mnemonics should be considered a useful
stepping-stone towards getting there, not an easy way out of having to
absorb the language.</p>

<p>The most common method is the <strong>keyword method</strong>. This links the word
you want to learn to a similar-sounding word in your native language.
For example: Imagine you want to learn the French word for <em>car</em>:
<em>voiture</em>. You might note that the word <em>voiture</em> sounds like <em>vulture</em>
in English. You can mentally link the two by imagining a car with a
vulture on top of it, or, if you are very imaginative, a car shaped like
a vulture. Now, when you want to talk about a car, you’ll remember the
vulture and that the French word sounds like <em>vulture</em>, hence reminding
you to say <em>voiture</em>. The more vivid, bizarre, or surprising your
mnemonics are, the more effective they will be. You will be surprised by
how well they work.</p>

<p>Further details are too much for this guide, so I will provide
you with some links to learn more on your own if you are interested.</p>

      <p>There are some learners who go mostly without studying grammar. This is done by compensating with lots of input, making sure to notice grammatical forms as you encounter them. It is best not to go without studying grammar until you are more experienced. Further discussion of the debate on the efficacy of grammar instruction can be found <a href="/languageguide/appendixe/#how-important-are-grammar-lessons">in the appendix</a>. <a href="#fnref:6" class="reversefootnote" role="doc-backlink">&#8617;</a></p>

      <p>This isn’t a completely free shortcut, as much of the meaning is contained in the less-common words.
