        <p>The advantage of learning good pronunciation is that it is probably the
easiest way to sound fluent at an upper beginner or intermediate stage,
and early effort will continue to help you throughout your language
endeavours. If you’re the outgoing type or are learning primarily to
communicate verbally, good pronunciation is a good way to keep people
happy conversing with you and get compliments on your skill.</p>

<p>Pronunciation is especially important for languages with very different
phonology, such as Chinese. This is because the differences are so great
as to make mispronunciation a barrier to communication. If you are
learning a tonal language or one with many new sounds, consider paying
closer attention to pronunciation.</p>

<p>Pronunciation can be split between sound, syllable, word, and sentence.
Every target language has different rules governing these. This is known
as the study of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetics">phonetics</a>,
split between <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonology">phonology</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prosody_(linguistics)">prosody</a>.</p>

<h1 id="what-to-learn">What to learn</h1>

<p>Here are several aspects you will need to look out for in your practice:</p>

<p><strong>Sound inventory:</strong> Every language has a set of distinct consonants and
vowels. These sounds can be very different from English (such as tones
and click consonants) or only slightly different.</p>

<p><strong>Oral posture:</strong> This is the way native speakers tend to hold the
muscles in their mouth.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tone_(linguistics)">Tone</a>:</strong> This is
the use of tone to distinguish morphemes. This means two words can be
identical but for their tone and carry completely different meanings. If
your target language is a tonal language you will need to become
proficient in order to communicate.</p>

<p><strong>Difficult sound clusters:</strong> Different languages have different rules
surrounding which sounds can fit into a single syllable. This means some
languages will have clusters of consonants you will find difficult to
pronounce.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stress_(linguistics)">Stress</a>:</strong>
Languages have different rules around what syllables are stressed within
words, as well as how they are stressed</p>

<p><strong>Connected speech:</strong> Words flow together in a way that makes them sound
different than if they were spoken individually. Notice how this
sentence sounds different in your mind. when. I. type. the. last. part.
like. this.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intonation_(linguistics)">Intonation</a>:</strong>
This is pitch when used to convey other types of information. The most
simple example is rising pitch to indicate a question. Intonation is
often used in other ways and these can differ between languages.</p>

<p><strong>Rhythm and tempo:</strong> Languages are spoken with a different sense of
pace and timing.</p>

<p>The next sections will elaborate on some of these aspects.</p>

<h2 id="sound-inventory">Sound inventory</h2>

<p>The difficulty with learning new sounds is understanding precisely how
to make them. If you would like to master the pronunciation of your
language, it helps a lot to learn some of the terminology around sounds
and parts of the mouth.</p>

<p>Your best tool for learning the sounds of your language is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">International Phonetic
Alphabet</a>
(IPA). The IPA is a system of writing all the sounds of human language.
Knowing the core sounds associated with your language and familiarity
with their IPA symbol is very useful. By googling any IPA symbol, you
can find the Wikipedia article describing it, which has a sound file to
help you.
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_phonology#Phonemes">Here</a> is the
Wikipedia entry for the phonology of English to help you.</p>

<p>Next I will provide you with some resources to understand the
fundamentals of consonants and vowels. It can be very easy to think you
are producing something correctly. However, careful study of the sounds
of your language can reveal differences you were not previously aware
of.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.britannica.com/science/phonetics">Encyclopedia Britannica entry on phonetics</a> will be a useful reference later on.</p>

<h3 id="vowels">Vowels</h3>

<p>The IPA also includes a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPA_vowel_chart_with_audio">vowel chart</a>, which is very useful for understanding how different vowels are formed.</p>

<p>Here is a great video analysing English accents that also serves as an interesting
introduction to the vowel chart:</p>

<h3 id="consonants">Consonants</h3>

<p>Consonants have three fundamental aspects. Here they are with links to a
series that describes them:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMEFr7ghMTg&amp;list=PLduA6tsl3gygfiWmGAhhHb4-HAqP6I63l">Place of articulation</a></p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="oral-posture">Oral posture</h2>

<p>Oral posture is one of the more difficult concepts to grasp, but
understanding it can provide a huge boost to your pronunciation. You can
think of oral posture as the natural resting place, or “home base”, of
the mouth of a native speaker. Every sound is produced from this base.</p>

<p>You can learn from this home base by adjusting the posture of your own
mouth when you are speaking. This should help you achieve more accurate
pronunciation.</p>

<p>Pronunciation guides rarely talk about oral posture, so the best way to
learn it is often by paying careful attention when watching a video of a
native speaker. The best time to spot this is often by watching the
mouth of the speaker when they pause between phrases, or by paying
attention to how they sound when they make the equivalent of our word
for <em>uhhh</em>.</p>

<p>Here is a video of an accent trainer describing French that may help you
understand the concept:</p>

<p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AozDoB-ev1c">link</a> on YouTube)</p>

<p>Here are some aspects to look out for:</p>

<h2 id="difficult-sound-clusters">Difficult sound clusters</h2>

<p>Consonant-heavy languages can be difficult to pronounce due to the
clusters of consonants that can take some time getting used to. These
are generally learned by practising them in isolation over and over.</p>

<h2 id="stress">Stress</h2>

<p>For most learners, it is important to pay focused attention to where and
how stress is placed on words. English stresses by a raising of pitch
and lengthening of the vowel. In other languages, stress can be more
subtle or expressed differently.</p>

<p>Here are some aspects of stress that may be relevant to your language:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch-accent_language">Pitch accent</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vowel_reduction">Vowel reduction</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="how-to-practise-pronunciation">How to practise pronunciation</h1>

<p>How easy your job is depends on how many resources exist on the
internet. I recommend you search for pronunciation guides online. If
you’re lucky, you can find a guide somewhere that takes you through all
the sounds and precisely how they are pronounced. The key is to identify
the aspects that will be difficult for you based on differences between
your native and target language and consciously practice these aspects.</p>

<p>It may take some time to train your ear. For a while, different sounds
will seem the same to you, but if you persevere, they will eventually
begin to sound different. Eventually, you will wonder how they ever
sounded alike.</p>

<p>You don’t need to learn everything about pronunciation at the start. A
good understanding of each of the main sounds is sufficient. A lot of
pronunciation skill comes naturally as you begin to talk more and try to
bring your speech to resemble more closely that of native speakers you
hear.</p>

<p>I recommend you plan out some sessions where you focus on pronunciation
early on, ideally when you first start speaking. To do this, you can use
the suggested exercises below.</p>

<h2 id="exercises">Exercises</h2>

<p>As I mentioned, you will need to spend time isolating the aspects that
are relevant to your language and focusing on improving them. Dedicate
some time to doing some activities in which you practise speaking some
words alone in front of your computer. You don’t need to do this too
much, just until your brain is made aware of what it needs to do to make
the new sound. After that you can gradually integrate the sound
naturally as you practice your language.</p>

<p>Use good dictionaries to help you.
<a href="https://www.wiktionary.org/">Wiktionary</a> is the most consistent
dictionary in showing the IPA pronunciation. <a href="https://forvo.com/">Forvo</a>
is a great pronunciation dictionary.</p>

<h2 id="overcoming-the-mental-hurdle">Overcoming the mental hurdle</h2>

<p>One of the biggest hurdles to enabling adult learners to speak with a
good accent is purely psychological. That is, we are afraid of sounding
silly when we speak. The result is we default to the way that sounds the
least silly to us—the sounds of our native language. It is important to
understand that good pronunciation will initially feel very weird to
you.</p>

<p>A helpful tip is to try speaking your target language with an
exaggerated caricature of how people from that country speak your native
language. More often than not, you will land much closer to a good
estimation of the correct pronunciation than by starting from the
default of your native language.</p>
