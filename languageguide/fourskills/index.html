        <p>In this section we’ll be looking at how to improve your acquisition of the four skills.</p>

<p>The four skills are best learned through practice followed by exercises that focus on the skills separately. I recommend you focus on the skills most closely related to your goal. For example, if you want to have conversations, you need to focus on listening and speaking.</p>

<h1 id="readingwriting">Reading/writing</h1>

<h2 id="orthography">Orthography</h2>

<p>Orthography is the way the letters correspond to the sounds of your language. Languages exist on a continuum, from those with a very high correspondence of letters to sound to those whose pronunciation can be difficult to guess based on spelling. Orthography should be covered by your beginner course. I advise you pay attention to it.</p>

<h2 id="learning-a-new-script">Learning a new script</h2>

<p>Those learning a language with a different writing system should start learning it early on. A good language course will start by teaching you
the new system. It is best to prioritise this. Learning a new writing
system is not as hard as it seems. At first the new symbols or
characters can be confusing, but with practice they will gradually
become easier until it’s just like reading English.</p>

<p>The best way to learn a new script is by using it. Start trying to
understand the basics and move quickly into applying your knowledge by
reading simple sentences and words.</p>

<p>For those learning a language with characters such as Chinese <em>hanzi</em> or
Japanese <em>kanji</em>, learning to read and write can be a long, slow
process. It is generally recommended to start early. The best way to
learn them is already well-covered elsewhere. I recommend you search
online to find a good guide.</p>

<h1 id="listening">Listening</h1>

<p>Listening well is mostly comprised of the ability to hear sounds and
distinguish and understand words quickly.</p>

<h3 id="practising-listening">Practising listening</h3>

<p>It is helpful to practise listening throughout your learning using
beginner podcasts or other audio resources. This aspect is often
underemphasised in beginner courses. Here are some ways you can improve
your listening:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Listen to resources that have a written transcription; read and
listen first, then try to listen without the transcript</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find listening resources that are deliberately slowed down</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use listening resources that are easier than something you would
typically read; this allows you to focus solely on listening without
being distracted by unknown words or grammar</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spend time learning how letters correspond to sounds (orthography)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 id="speaking">Speaking</h1>

<p>Speaking is a combination of accurate pronunciation and good knowledge
of words and forms. To become good at speaking it helps to develop good
listening as well, since it is difficult to produce sounds you cannot
distinguish.</p>

<h2 id="learning-pronunciation">Learning pronunciation</h2>

<p>Unless you are learning a tonal language, learning good pronunciation is
not absolutely essential, especially for a beginner; however, good
pronunciation can ease communication a lot, while poor pronunciation learned
during the early stages can become ingrained and hard to fix.</p>

<p>Good pronunciation typically does not come naturally to adult learners,
so it can be important to pay focused attention. If you want a good
accent, I recommend you learn as you start speaking, aiming to get the
sounds mostly correct every time you speak.</p>

<p>What follows is a quick guide to get you most of the way. The full guide to learning pronunciation is in <a href="/languageguide/appendixa">Appendix A</a></p>

<p>I recommend you use Google or search a community to find a pronunciation guide for your
target language. The best guides will explain each sound using diagrams,
explanations, or special symbols (called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">IPA</a>) in
addition to audio to show you how they sound.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>Spend focused effort improving those aspects of your language you find
difficult. Use a dictionary such as <a href="https://forvo.com/">Forvo</a> or
<a href="https://www.wiktionary.org/">Wiktionary</a> or any audio input to get a
good example to try mimic. It is helpful to practise throughout your
study by trying to read texts, flashcards, or anything you encounter
aloud.</p>

<h2 id="remembering-words-and-forms">Remembering words and forms</h2>

<p>When first speaking, many learners find themselves struggling to
remember the words they need.</p>

<p>There is a difference between your ability to understand words and using
them yourself in speech; however, this barrier can be overcome. These
two types of knowledge (understanding and producing) link to the same
concept; they are different, but not fundamentally so. The simple fact
is that producing requires finding the word in your memory without an
easy reference, making it harder to do.</p>

<p>The most natural way this gap is bridged is by gradually building
greater familiarity with the word over time. Often, learners are only
superficially familiar with a word, making it hard to remember. However,
with exposure and experience, words eventually gain a certain salience
that lets them come to mind when needed. Often, the best course of
action is to simply be patient and practise.</p>

<p>If a word is particularly important, it can help to practise that word
productively. You can do this by practising speaking aloud, writing
sentences, or by simply using your flashcards productively.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-summary">Chapter summary</h1>

<p>Focus on using comprehensible input to acquire your language. Start by
reading and listening as much as you can, then consider speaking and
writing later on.</p>

<p>All your grammar and vocabulary will be acquired through one of the four
mediums (direct explanation, drilling, encountering in your content, and
language output). Your beginner course will do a lot of the work to
introduce you to a lot; however, you will generally need to do a lot of
flashcard study and reading and listening to build your knowledge.</p>

<p>Start by learning the 1,000 most common words as quickly as you can.
Don’t over-focus on grammar, but don’t ignore it either.</p>

<p>Focus on learning your language’s script if it is different and focus on
pronunciation if you want a good accent. For both of these, early effort
will pay off in the long-term.</p>
