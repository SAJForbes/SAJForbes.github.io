        <p>Now that you hopefully have a good grasp of how to learn a language, I can turn to some great activities to do as you approach the intermediate stage. Although they are best suited for intermediate learners, I’m including them in the beginner section as they can be highly beneficial even for upper-beginner-level learners.</p>

<h1 id="drill-your-language-using-content">Drill your language using content</h1>

<p>The purpose of drilling with content is use content to focus on a key
 aspect of your language and develop it with the help of the broader
 context. This is a core intermediate activity that is optional for
 beginners. You can find more info on using input .</p>

<p>Get a piece of content that you already understand 90–98% of. This will
 ideally have a written component, such as a text, video with subtitles,
 or podcast with a transcript. You will then read or listen to your
 content multiple times (up to ten, even). Repetition is a powerful
 principle that ensures you remember what you learn. Each time you will
 read more carefully and try to gain new insight.</p>

<p>The reason you read the content multiple times is that understanding the
 entirety of text, audio, or video content at once is usually too
 difficult. It’s impossible to remember the meaning of all new words and
 forms as well as comprehend the meaning of entire sentences and how they
 flow together to make a broader point on your first read through. The
 best approach is to chunk it up into manageable activities so that
 nothing is too difficult.</p>

<p>Here are the key phases:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Skim read for broader context—lets you derive meaning from context
more easily</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Brief read—read quickly without looking anything up, try to guess
the meaning of key words</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Deeper read—read again, focusing on those parts that are still
unclear to you</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Lookup—search for the meaning of key words and forms that are
preventing you from understanding fully</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Repeat reading—as many times as necessary to understand the text</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Alternate between <em>lookup</em> and <em>repeat reading</em> as much as you need.</p>

<p>At some point you may narrow down to a component of the language you
 would like to focus on improving. You can also follow-up by using the
 resource for a range of activities. Here are some ideas:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Practise listening to an audio recording</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Drill some key vocabulary with flashcards</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Produce a written summary of the resource</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Read the text aloud</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Send the written summary to a native to be corrected</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Discuss it with a tutor</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>If by the end you can comfortably understand the content,
 congratulations! You are now measurably better at your target language.</p>

<h1 id="extensive-reading">Extensive reading</h1>

<p>Reading is probably the best way to continue to improve your
 understanding of vocabulary and grammar. It is a great exercise, even if
 your objective is to speak.<sup id="fnref:9" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> Vocabulary size is strongly correlated
 with time spent reading,<sup id="fnref:10" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> so it’s a great way to boost your
 vocabulary.</p>

<p>There is nothing objectively wrong with listening instead, however
 written content has everything easily accessible to be referenced,
 returned to, and looked up. It is also better in terms of sheer quantity
 of content available to learners, meaning there are more things that
 interest you available in the written form. Reading and listening are
 simply different ways of accessing the core components (vocabulary and
 grammar), which remain largely unchanged between the two content types.
 Feel free to listen to audiobooks or podcasts if you prefer.</p>

<p>The key to extensive reading is that you read widely and a lot. Content
 you use will need to already be 98% understandable to you. Use the to
 find some good tools and content to read.</p>

<h2 id="find-a-book">Find a book</h2>

<p>The most common way learners tend to get lots of language exposure is by
 finding a book they enjoy reading. Graded readers, which are tailored to
 your level, are ideal. Learners often find books for teens or even
 pre-teens that they enjoy enough to read. If the book is a translation
 of one you have already read in your native language, that will help you
 read a more difficult book without losing track of what is happening.
 Here are some books that are commonly re-read by learners:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <em>Harry Potter</em> series</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The <em>Goosebumps</em> books</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>The Little Prince</em></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In addition, there are books written specifically for learners at
 various levels. You can find them on Amazon.</p>

<h1 id="conversation-practice">Conversation practice</h1>

<p>The purpose of language is communication and to communicate you need to
 speak. Conversation is a great exercise because it gets your brain
 actively utilising the knowledge you already have, greatly improving
 your understanding and fluency with the language. It also exercises the
 skills of speaking and listening in tandem, it exposes you to native
 speaker content, exposes you to new forms and vocabulary, and lets you
 get help and feedback in real time. Many learners report a burst of
 insight that can come from beginning to speak as their target language
 turns from memorised rules and phrases into a living language that they
 can interact with.</p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Principle: Get feedback on your ability</strong>
 <br />
 A good way to catch errors is to find ways to get feedback on any
 mistakes you are making. While your language should get better with time
 on its own, it can be helpful to catch some mistakes you are repeatedly
 producing so that they don’t become a permanent feature of your speech
 or writing. Try asking for feedback from your tutor or language partner.
 You can also try your hand at writing and sending small texts to native
 speakers to be corrected.</p>

<p>Other than listening and speaking skill, which has already been
 addressed, there are three common barriers learners experience beginning
 to speak. I will address each of them with a section. They are: knowing
 when to start speaking, getting conversation practice, and confidence.</p>

<h2 id="when-to-start-speaking">When to start speaking</h2>

<p>Some people emphasise speaking as early as possible, even on the first
 day. The first time speaking a language can be a powerful experience, as
 well as great way to solidify knowledge recently gained. Keep in mind
 that speaking can be very hard for beginners without a tutor or highly
 accommodating language partner. In addition, there is plenty to be
 gained by doing other activities and leaving speaking for later. For
 that reason, it is a completely valid and common choice to avoid
 speaking almost entirely until you are at a lower-intermediate level.
 Many people find speaking helpful and prefer to start earlier, while
 others only speak early because they find it fun or motivating. When to
 begin speaking is your choice—there is no proven best time.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-get-conversation-practice">How to get conversation practice</h2>

<p>The best way to practise speaking is to find a native speaker and start
 a language exchange, an activity in which you each spend time speaking
 each other’s language. You can do this by organising with people in your
 real life if you have any native speakers around. If you are like the
 majority of us and do not have anybody nearby, the best option is to do
 an online exchange using Skype or any other internet calling service.
 You can find people very easily by using a community dedicated to
 language exchanges. Use the to find a service that works for you.</p>

<p>There are other methods of getting practice. If you live in a big city,
 there are often meetups for language enthusiasts or more generic meetups
 that are often attended by expatriates and travellers. You might get
 lucky and find a native speaker there who is willing to let you practise
 if you ask them. The country associated with your language may have a
 community of speakers in your city. You can also pay for a tutor to get
 conversation practice, either online or in real life if available.</p>

<h2 id="building-confidence">Building confidence</h2>

<p>The next big barrier to fluent speech is usually a lack of confidence.
 Having the confidence to just try even if you might be wrong ensures you
 maximise your opportunity to practise speaking.</p>

<p>If you are feeling nervous or anxious about starting to speak, it is
 best to ease yourself in. Find a good conversation partner. Most people
 will be accommodating. A good partner will understand your level and
 speak at an appropriate level for you. In return, any help they give
 using your language will be good practice for them. Make sure you are
 clear about your level and your initial difficulty will not be a
 problem. If you have the money, hiring a tutor can be a good way to ease
 yourself into speaking with less pressure.</p>

<p>The initial hurdle of starting to speak is the largest, but there is no
 way around it. After that, speaking becomes increasingly easier, even
 when first speaking any future languages you may learn.</p>

<p class="notice--danger"><strong>Key tip: Don’t be afraid to make mistakes</strong>
<br />
Don’t shy away from trying things because you are afraid of making
mistakes. Mistakes are a natural part of the process of learning and
will not necessarily hinder your progress. Conversely, trying to use the
language absolutely correctly every time can slow your progress by
reducing the amount of practice you get.
<br />
Most mistakes simply fix themselves over time without correction. As
long as you are getting lots of input and basing your language
production off that, you will probably be fine. Listen closely next time
you are near a young child. They make mistakes all the time, yet all
will learn to a native level given enough time.</p>
