        <p>In this chapter we will look at how you learn, starting from the core
principles and moving to how you learn, grammar, vocabulary, and the
four skills.</p>

<h1 id="comprehensible-input">Comprehensible input</h1>

<p>If you take nothing else from this book, understand this: <strong>you acquire
your language when you use it</strong>. This idea comes from a book by linguist
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Krashen">Stephen Krashen</a>.
Krashen’s insight gives rise to the single most important principle in
language learning. You will see it repeated throughout this guide:</p>

<p class="notice--info"><strong>Principle: Use the language in order to learn it</strong>
<br />
The best way for you to learn a language is by engaging with it
meaningfully, achieving comprehension of real information. To do that
you need a large amount of input that is both <strong>comprehensible</strong> and
<strong>interesting</strong> to <strong>you</strong>. That can mean reading texts, listening to
podcasts, watching videos, writing stories, finding native speakers to
practise with, or anything else that takes your fancy. Languages are
learned when you encounter grammar and vocabulary and are prompted to
recall their meaning or produce it in context.</p>

<p>Learning does not happen after completing textbook exercises, memorising
a word or rule, or repeating after a teacher. Language is a skill you
must practice and refine. In many ways, it is more like learning to ride
a bike or play an instrument than learning facts or rules. Without
seeing how it all goes together you will not learn to use the language,
nor will anything you learn through exercises stick. Later, speaking and
writing in a low-pressure environment will further solidify your
knowledge and let you practice the skills essential to use your
language.</p>

<p>You can find Krashen’s book, <em>Principle and Practice in Second Language
Acquisition</em>, free online
<a href="http://www.sdkrashen.com/content/books/principles_and_practice.pdf">here</a>,
watch a great video demonstration
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnUc_W3xE1w">here</a>, or read a summary
of the book
<a href="https://www.languagecorpus.com/krashen-summary-of-principles-and-practice-in-second-language-acquisition">here</a>.</p>

<p>In the next three sections we will cover how to approach grammar,
vocabulary, and the four skills.</p>

<h1 id="grammar">Grammar</h1>

<p>While it might seem like there is a lot of grammar to get your head
around, the core grammar of a language forms a kind of “hump” that, once
you get past it, opens the language up and enables progression with
greater ease. Once you’re done with the core grammar, you will probably
never have to approach it as systematically again.</p>

<p>Your initial grammar learning comes from your beginner course. This can
be supplemented by exercises such as sentence flashcards and exercises;
however, this should not be the majority of your time. Of the four
mediums, the most effective will be <em>Encountering in your content</em>.<sup id="fnref:6" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p class="notice--danger"><strong>Key tip: Do not rely on memorising grammar rules</strong>
<br />
In general, memorising rules is a poor way to acquire a language.
Learning only happens when you use the language. Rules and other aides
such as conjugation tables should be used as a stepping stone to help
you understand meaning in context.</p>

<p class="notice--danger"><strong>Key tip: Avoid spending all your time on grammar</strong>
<br />
While the noticeable progress feels good, you will learn faster overall
with the help of input and context supplementing your learning.
Languages are much more than grammar rules and you will not learn by
studying grammar in isolation.</p>

<h2 id="flashcard-phrases-for-grammar">Flashcard phrases for grammar</h2>

<p>Learners commonly experience difficulty remembering how to use grammar when first speaking, or simply struggle to remember how the rule works in context. For this, memorising phrases can be very powerful.</p>

<p>Grammar flashcards generally consist of a single sentence, as simple as
possible, that demonstrates the particular grammatical rule used in
context. This might be as simple as creating a set of cards for all the
verb conjugations, one for each type. It can be helpful to bold or
highlight the particular feature you want to focus on.</p>

<p>Productive learning is preferred over receptive because understanding grammar receptively is
generally too easy to do when you have context, especially for languages
closer to English.</p>

<p>I recommend you use phrases from your course or the internet to ensure
they are correct—grammar can be very easy to get wrong as a beginner.</p>

<h1 id="vocabulary">Vocabulary</h1>

<p>Vocabulary is generally the more underrated of the two core components.
A huge portion of speaking a language is really just knowing enough
words.</p>

<p>For a language like English, the number of words you’d need to be fluent
is over 10,000. Increasing your vocabulary is therefore always a useful
task when you don’t know what to study. While 10,000 is a large number,
you will get there eventually by chipping away at it every day.</p>

<p>Start off by learning the 1,000 most common words as fast as possible.
Stretch for 2,000 if you can. That lets you understand a lot of basic
language.</p>

<p>Beginners typically learn vocabulary in three main ways:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Words introduced through your beginner course</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Flashcard drills</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Reading and listening</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>It is rare that you will learn a word simply by having it introduced to
you once. Vocabulary is learned after repeated exposure, either in
content or with flashcards.</p>

<p class="notice--danger"><strong>Key tip: Prioritise words over grammar</strong>
<br />
Prioritise increasing your vocabulary over learning advanced grammar. In conversation,
advanced grammar can often easily be understood through context. This is
rarely true of unknown words, unless they happen to include roots or
affixes that are already familiar. If you’re not convinced,
take note of how often you struggle to understand the sense of what is
being said because of grammar versus vocabulary. Children passively understand far more words than adult learners by the
time they begin using more complex grammar, and this is for a good
reason. Not knowing the correct word is a far more common barrier than grammar.</p>

<h2 id="what-words-should-i-learn">What words should I learn?</h2>

<p>There are two primary criteria you should use. These are <strong>personal
relevance</strong> and <strong>frequency</strong>.</p>

<p>Learning words that are personally relevant to you is a good way to
ensure you are practising what you are learning. To meet this criterion,
the words you learn need to be <strong>appearing in your resources often</strong> or
be ones you think you will need to meet your goals.</p>

<p>Choosing words based on the frequency they appear in the language is
useful as they are the most likely to be useful to you in the future.
Words in natural language follow something called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law">Zipf’s
Law</a>. This means that the
most common word will occur twice as often as the next most common word,
which will occur twice as often as the next most common, and so on. This
means languages are heavily dominated by the most common words. <strong>Once
you have learned 2,000–3,000 words, you have covered almost all the
words you will hear in daily conversation</strong>. With only a few hundred
words, you will have access to almost all the filler words, which make
up most of spoken language.<sup id="fnref:7" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>contained in the less-common words. What it will do is put you in a good
position to learn these words naturally and better derive meaning from
context.</p>

<p class="notice--danger"><strong>Key tip: Don’t learn closely related words together</strong>
<br />
Although it might seem like a good idea, it’s best <strong>not</strong> to learn
words together if they are related. This is because the
similarities can cause you to confuse them. This includes near synonyms
(rely/depend), opposites (fast/slow), and words typically recounted
together (days of the week, numbers).
<br />
It is acceptable to learn words together that belong to a common theme,
as this can help you build a story in your mind.</p>

<h2 id="word-lists">Word Lists</h2>

<p>You may find it helpful to keep a list of those words or phrases you
have looked up and find interesting enough to want to remember. This can
serve as a useful reference and the act of writing a list by hand can
aid memorisation. This is not mandatory.</p>

<p>Word lists should not simply be read over, but revised with one side
covered to get your memory working.</p>

<h2 id="mnemonics">Mnemonics</h2>

<p>Mnemonics are versatile tool that turns vocabulary into easy-to-recall
mental images that help you remember a word. Mnemonics can be very
useful to learn vocabulary quickly; however, the word won’t be truly
learned until you don’t need the mnemonic and can use and understand the
word automatically. Mnemonics should be considered a useful
stepping-stone towards getting there, not an easy way out of having to
absorb the language.</p>

<p>The most common method is the <strong>keyword method</strong>. This links the word
you want to learn to a similar-sounding word in your native language.
For example: Imagine you want to learn the French word for <em>car</em>:
<em>voiture</em>. You might note that the word <em>voiture</em> sounds like <em>vulture</em>
in English. You can mentally link the two by imagining a car with a
vulture on top of it, or, if you are very imaginative, a car shaped like
a vulture. Now, when you want to talk about a car, you’ll remember the
vulture and that the French word sounds like <em>vulture</em>, hence reminding
you to say <em>voiture</em>. The more vivid, bizarre, or surprising your
mnemonics are, the more effective they will be. You will be surprised by
how well they work.</p>

<p>Further details are too much for a guide such as this, so I will provide
you with some links to learn more on your own if you are interested.</p>

  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="learning-numbers">Learning numbers</h2>

<p>Learning numbers can be a surprisingly difficult task, particularly with
large ones, making dates an early challenge for many learners. It helps
to spend focused effort learning them through drills. You may find
<a href="https://langpractice.com/">LangPractice</a> helpful for this.</p>

<h1 id="the-four-skills">The four skills</h1>

<p>The four skills are best learned through practice followed by exercises
that focus on the skills separately. I recommend you focus on the skills most closely related to your goal.
For example, if you want to have conversations, you need to focus on
listening and speaking.</p>

<p>Because there is relatively little for me to say, the reading/writing aspect of this section is focused only on learning a new script. You can skip it if you are learning a language that uses the latin alphabet.</p>

<h2 id="learning-a-new-script">Learning a new script</h2>

<p>Those learning a language with a different writing system should start there. A good language course will start by teaching you
the new system. It is best to prioritise this. Learning a new writing
system is not as hard as it seems. At first the new symbols or
characters can be confusing, but with practice they will gradually
become easier until it’s just like reading English.</p>

<p>The best way to learn a new script is by using it. Start trying to
understand the basics and move quickly into applying your knowledge by
reading simple sentences and words.</p>

<p>For those learning a language with characters such as Chinese <em>hanzi</em> or
Japanese <em>kanji</em>, learning to read and write can be a long, slow
process. It is generally recommended to start early. The best way to
learn them is already well-covered elsewhere. I recommend you search
online to find a good guide.</p>

<h2 id="listening">Listening</h2>

<p>Listening well is mostly comprised of the ability to hear sounds and
distinguish and understand words quickly.</p>

<h3 id="practising-listening">Practising listening</h3>

<p>It is helpful to practise listening throughout your learning using
beginner podcasts or other audio resources. This aspect is often
underemphasised in beginner courses. Here are some ways you can improve
your listening:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Listen to resources that have a written transcription; read and
listen first, then try to listen without the transcript</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Find listening resources that are deliberately slowed down</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Use listening resources that are easier than something you would
typically read; this allows you to focus solely on listening without
being distracted by unknown words or grammar</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Spend time learning how letters correspond to sounds (orthography)</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="speaking">Speaking</h2>

<p>Speaking is a combination of accurate pronunciation and good knowledge
of words and forms. To become good at speaking it helps to develop good
listening as well, since it is difficult to produce sounds you cannot
distinguish.</p>

<h3 id="learning-pronunciation">Learning pronunciation</h3>

<p>Unless you are learning a tonal language, learning good pronunciation is
not absolutely essential, especially for a beginner; however, good
pronunciation can ease communication a lot, while poor pronunciation learned
during the early stages can become ingrained and hard to fix.</p>

<p>Good pronunciation typically does not come naturally to adult learners,
so it can be important to pay focused attention. If you want a good
accent, I recommend you learn as you start speaking, aiming to get the
sounds mostly correct every time you speak.</p>

<p>What follows is a quick guide to get you most of the way. The full guide to learning pronunciation is in <a href="/languageguide/appendixa">Appendix A</a></p>

<p>I recommend you use Google or search a community to find a pronunciation guide for your
target language. The best guides will explain each sound using diagrams,
explanations, or special symbols (called the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet">IPA</a>) in
addition to audio to show you how they sound.<sup id="fnref:8" role="doc-noteref"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>an English approximation for each sound. This is OK to start but is
insufficient to achieve accurate pronunciation.</p>

<p>Spend focused effort improving those aspects of your language you find
difficult. Use a dictionary such as <a href="https://forvo.com/">Forvo</a> or
<a href="https://www.wiktionary.org/">Wiktionary</a> or any audio input to get a
good example to try mimic. It is helpful to practise throughout your
study by trying to read texts, flashcards, or anything you encounter
aloud.</p>

<h3 id="remembering-words-and-forms">Remembering words and forms</h3>

<p>When first speaking, many learners find themselves struggling to
remember the words they need.</p>

<p>There is a difference between your ability to understand words and using
them yourself in speech; however, this barrier can be overcome. These
two types of knowledge (understanding and producing) link to the same
concept; they are different, but not fundamentally so. The simple fact
is that producing requires finding the word in your memory without an
easy reference, making it harder to do.</p>

<p>The most natural way this gap is bridged is by gradually building
greater familiarity with the word over time. Often, learners are only
superficially familiar with a word, making it hard to remember. However,
with exposure and experience, words eventually gain a certain salience
that lets them come to mind when needed. Often, the best course of
action is to simply be patient and practise.</p>

<p>If a word is particularly important, it can help to practise that word
productively. You can do this by practising speaking aloud, writing
sentences, or by simply using your flashcards productively.</p>

<h1 id="chapter-summary">Chapter summary</h1>

<p>Focus on using comprehensible input to acquire your language. Start by
reading and listening as much as you can, then consider speaking and
writing later on.</p>

<p>All your grammar and vocabulary will be acquired through one of the four
mediums (direct explanation, drilling, encountering in your content, and
language output). Your beginner course will do a lot of the work to
introduce you to a lot; however, you will generally need to do a lot of
flashcard study and reading and listening to build your knowledge.</p>

<p>Start by learning the 1,000 most common words as quickly as you can.
Don’t over-focus on grammar, but don’t ignore it either.</p>

<p>Focus on learning your language’s script if it is different and focus on
pronunciation if you want a good accent. For both of these, early effort
will pay off in the long-term.</p>

      <p>There are some learners who go mostly without studying grammar. This is done by compensating with lots of input, making sure to notice grammatical forms as you encounter them. It is best not to go without studying grammar until you are more experienced.
