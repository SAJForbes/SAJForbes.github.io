# Principles of approach


-   Build a base and work up—start with simpler concepts first then build up from there

-   Work towards your goals—practice whatever tasks you are learning the language for

-   Keep up your motivation—find ways to stay interested in the language

-   Spend as much time as you can with your language—Time is the key determiner of how fast you learn

-   Trust the process—learning can be a slow process, so sometimes you need to trust that
    you will progress with time

-   80 percent of your results come from 20 percent of your study—find the most effective activities and biggest weaknesses and focus
    on them

-   Push yourself—constantly challenge yourself by moving on to harder resources

# Principles of learning


-   Use the language in order to learn it—listen and read as much as possible, you will learn the language
    when you use it, not when you learn about it

-   Repetition—you need to encounter something a lot before you learn it

-   Engage your memory—try to actively recall the meaning of words and forms before you
    look them up

-   Noticing—Noticing forms in your content is a powerful way to learn

-   Don’t try to learn things perfectly the frst time you encounter them—you need to see the language in context a lot before it will stick
    in your mind

# Principles of practice

-   Get feedback on your ability—feedback helps you catch errors

-   Your level +1—use content just a bit above your level

-   Practise then dril—find weaknesses in your language skill then isolate them with
    drills
