This chapter will show you how to find resources and help you think about which ones will work for you. After that, we'll be looking at how you put them together to make a language method.

# How to find resources

There are three good ways to find resources:

 1.  Google search for communities of learners that are learning your
     target language—often there will be lists of recommended resources
     or a popular post by a user

 2.  Google search for guides or articles about learning your target
     language

 3.  Language repositories—these will be explained next

 Every time you encounter a good guide or a resource you think you might
 like, bookmark it, then keep looking. Only go back to look at the best
 ones once you’ve spent some time searching.

## Language repositories

Language repositories link or store a large number of language resources in one place. **Well-curated** repositories can be a great place to find useful resources for your language; however, non-curated repositories that simply list lots of resources without ranking them can be overwhelming and often include low-quality resources. The top two listed below are well-curated and recommended.

 **Some popular language resource repositories**

 | **Repository**                                                                                  | **Description**                                                                    |

# Choosing resources

Because there are many resources that only deal with one language, this guide does not represent the full range of high-quality resources available. Your own research should hopefully unearth more recommendations from other learners. If you don’t find anything, you’ll still have this chapter.

There are three key factors you should consider when assessing whether a
resource is worth trying:

  1.  If it is recommended by other learners

  2.  How much you think you will enjoy using it

  3.  How well it fits the archetype of a good resource outlined in this
      chapter

# The three core resources

 There are many different types of resources; however, there are three
 core classes we will look at:

 1.  A beginner course

 2.  A flashcard program

 3.  Input

 **A beginner course** is any kind of course that tries to teach you the
 fundamentals, such as the core grammar and basic vocabulary in a
 structured manner.

 **A flashcard program** helps you learn vocabulary and grammar by
 repeatedly showing you words or sentences and asking you to recollect
 their meaning.

 **Input** is any piece of content produced in the language such as
 books, news, or movies.

 The three core classes of resource are crucial for developing your
 language method—the combination of resources and exercises you will use.

 Next we will look at each of these types of resource and what to look for.

# Beginner course

 There are six basic types of beginner courses you can use. It will be up
 to you to choose which you prefer.

 1.  **Online text, audio, or video explanations**—websites, podcasts, or
     video series that explain the basics of your language

 2.  **Teach-yourself books**—books that provide explanations, exercises,
     and beginner input (highly popular)

 3.  **Online courses**—often websites and/or apps with their own
     methodology (also very popular)

 4.  **Listen-and-repeat courses**—courses that function by having you
     listen to phrases and then repeatedly prompting you to recall and
     say them out loud

 5.  **Classes**—teachers in a classroom

 6.  **Tutors**—one-on-one teaching

**Some good examples of beginner courses**

 | **Course**    | **Examples**     |
 |:----------------|:-----------------------------|
 | Text, audio, or video explanations | YouTube videos <br /> Free online lectures/courses such as listed [here](http://www.openculture.com/freelanguagelessons/) <br /> [Assimil](https://www.assimil.com/) (paid, audio) <br /> [BBC Languages](http://www.bbc.co.uk/languages/) (free) <br /> [Live Lingua Project](https://www.livelingua.com/project/) (free resources) <br /> [FSI, DLI, and Peace Corps language courses](https://fsi-languages.yojik.eu/) <br />  |
 | Teach-yourself books  | [Colloquial series](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B088RLYM7M)                        |
 | Online courses        | [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) (free) <br /> [LingVist](https://lingvist.com/) (paid) <br /> [Busuu](https://www.busuu.com/) (free with paid premium) <br /> [Glossika](https://ai.glossika.com/) (paid) <br /> [Babbel](https://uk.babbel.com/) (paid) <br /> [Mango Languages](https://mangolanguages.com/) (paid)       |

 You may also find [Cooljugator](https://cooljugator.com/) useful if your
 language has large amounts of verb conjugations.

## What makes a good beginner course?

 **The course you choose should be one that you like and is recommended
 by other learners**. Remember: There is plenty of room for personal
 preference. Choose something that you think works for you. You can
 change courses over the course of your learning.

 A good course:

 -   Focuses on teaching the language in context using input

 -   Has interesting lessons or content

 -   Uses interactive lessons

 -   Covers all the bases: grammar, vocabulary, and the four skills

 -   Allows you to follow your interest

 -   Provides the appropriate amount of information to enable learning

 A bad course:

 -   Uses few examples or minimal content

 -   Has boring content or presentation

 -   Lets lessons be easily completed by passively reading or watching

 -   Focuses too much on one aspect and/or ignores other aspects

 -   Forces you to complete drills or activities before you can move on

 -   Ignores grammar or does not provide any explanation when needed

 No course is perfect, but the downsides of the course you use can be countered by the other components of your method. It is common for learners to use multiple courses where their relative strengths and weaknesses balance out. For example, you may use a tutor in addition to your course to practice speaking and get better explanations; or you might use a teach yourself book in addition to a listen-and-repeat course to help improve your vocabulary and listening.

 The different types of courses I outlined also have their own advantages
 and disadvantages:

**Advantages and disadvantages of each of the six types of beginner course**

 | **Course**   | **Advantages**  | **Disadvantages**  |
 |:-------------|:----------------|:-------------------|
 | Text, audio, or video explanations | Plenty of variety, usually free, and easy to use | Quality is variable and remembering what is taught is usually left to the learner |
 | Teach-yourself books  | Courses are usually complete and good quality | Sometimes rely on ineffective grammar exercises; not very interactive             |
 | Online courses                     | Often the highest quality, interactive, and can provide the full set of resources a learner needs                                       | Often pricey and may require an ongoing subscription                              |
 | Listen-and-repeat courses          | Great for travellers, very good at helping you start to speak, get a feel for the language, and remember and use lots of useful phrases | Not well-rounded                                                                  |
 | Classes                            | Help students stay motivated; teachers can provide correction and language feedback.                                                    | Costly; can be a slow way of learning the language if lessons are not frequent    |
 | Tutors                             | Very powerful method; can provide correction and language feedback                                                                      | Multiple lessons are very costly; often only used as a supplement for this reason |



 **Key tip: Change courses if you need to**
 \
 Learners commonly change courses as they reach a point where their
 current one becomes boring or too easy. Switching is a valid choice if
 your new course still challenges you and helps you learn; however, I
 don’t advise you do so repeatedly.

## Using listen-and-repeat courses

 Listen-and-repeat courses are perfect for people who are travelling soon
 and need tourist phrases as well as anyone that doesn’t have a lot of
 time to study at their desk. They’re also great at building confidence
 speaking early-on.

 If your focus is on communicating, listen-and-repeat courses are
 recommended. Because they are so specialised, I advise using them as a
 supplement. If you are less interested in communicating, consider them
 optional.

## Using Tutors

 Tutors are one of the best supplementary resources as they can structure
 learning to your preference. Tutors are highly recommended for those who
 can afford them.

 Since tutors can be expensive, using one simply to explain the basics to
 you is not the best use of your money. Any information they give you
 will also be freely available on YouTube or another website. It is
 generally a better use of your money to use tutors as a source of input,
 to identify errors, help you start speaking, and provide correction.
 Remember: learning is a fundamentally internal process—you still need to
 put in hard work regardless of the source of the information.

 You can find tutors in real life, through your local community, library,
 or university. Relatively inexpensive tutors are also available online
 on websites such as [iTalki](https://www.italki.com/).

## Budget

 Budget can be an important consideration for many people. There is no
 direct correlation between price and quality—many poor resources cost
 money, while many of the best resources on the internet are free.
 However, there is a general trend towards paid resources being better.
 Paying for something that is recommended by others and works for you can
 be a good investment.

 If you prefer a cheaper option, a good path could be using text, audio,
 or video explanation or free online course in combination with a
 listen-and-repeat course. If you’re willing to spend a bit of money to
 make your life easier, you will likely find value in using a paid online
 course in combination with a personal tutor to help you practise and
 identify errors.

# Flashcard program

Flashcards are a powerful tool used primarily to learn new words and
 grammatical forms. While you can make them by hand, these days we have
 apps to make the process simpler and more convenient.

**Flashcard software**

 | **Flashcard software**       | **Description and links**    |
 |:-----------------------|:--------------------------|
 | [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) | [iPhone app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ankimobile-flashcards/id373493387/) (paid) <br /> [Android app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ichi2.anki&hl=en) (free) <br /> [Shared decks](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/) <br /> [Manual](https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/) |  
 | [Memrise](http://www.memrise.com/)  | An online flashcard program that focuses on using mnemonics  |
 | [Clozemaster](https://www.clozemaster.com/languages/) | A flashcard program that teaches using fill-the-blank sentences that features a rather gamified interface |
 | [Quizlet](http://quizlet.com/languages-and-vocab/) | An online flashcard system |
 | [LearnWithOliver](https://www.learnwitholiver.com/) | Another online flashcard system |

## What makes a good flashcard system?

 The best flashcard programs use spaced repetition. This works by
 automatically spacing out your revision using something called the
 [forgetting curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve). When
 you first learn a word, you are shown it again at very short intervals.
 With each revision, the interval becomes longer and longer until the
 word is safe in your long-term memory.

## Anki

 The most popular flashcard software is
 [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/). Anki is popular due to its free
 desktop and android app, large community, functionality,
 customisability, and clean interface. The flipside is that there can be
 a fairly steep learning curve, depending on what you want to do with it.
 I recommend you use the fantastic setup guide and introduction
 [here](https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-1/a/anki-setup/). You can also
 find some clear video explanations
 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxHji1wxxjE/) and
 [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zWtGmYZSEfs/).

 Anki allows its users to export and share flashcard decks they make.
 There are many pre-made shared decks for you to use to get started
 [here](https://ankiweb.net/shared/decks/). If you’re a complete
 beginner, find a deck with words ordered by frequency. The best decks
 also have example sentences. Feel free to download multiple and try them
 out.

### Settings

 The default settings are not particularly good. If you like, you can
 change it to more closely resemble the
 [settings](https://refold.la/roadmap/stage-1/a/anki-setup/#Recommended-Options-Settings)
 in the setup guide I linked above. Keep in mind, these settings are
 optimised for single words. If you use sentences, you will need to make
 it a bit more supportive with new cards and reviews.

 You will find yourself confused by Anki at some point, so it is
 recommended to read the manual soon after you download it. You can find
 it in the table above and [here](https://docs.ankiweb.net/#/).

# Input

Sometimes content will already be integrated into the course you are doing. Even if your lessons already include texts or audio, it will be useful to find your own that interest you. More content is always good.

Here are some examples of input you might use:

| **Mode**  | **Example**              |
|:----------|:-------------------------|
| Reading   | Books  <br /> Articles <br /> Reddit-like websites <br /> News websites <br /> Conversation transcripts |
| Watching  | Interviews <br /> YouTube channels <br /> Movies <br /> TV series                |
| Listening | Music <br /> Podcasts <br /> Dialogues for learners   |

## What makes good input?

 The best input is both **comprehensible** and **interesting** to
 **you**. This content is often intended specifically for adult
 beginners. As always, try to find recommendations from other learners.
 Here are the best resources you can find as a learner:

 -   YouTube channels with conversation or dialogue intended for adult
     learners

 -   Podcasts intended for learners

 -   Short stories for learners, in books or online

 -   Books for young teens

 -   Websites with articles or news intended for learners

 -   Graded readers

 -   Anything with audio and a text transcript

 -   Anything with naturalistic dialogues

 A common method is to use content intended for children; however, the
 vocabulary is often not very useful nor the topics very interesting to
 an adult.

 Content such as TV series, music, movies, and real news websites is
 generally made to be understood by adult native speakers. This content
 is usually too difficult for beginners to use effectively. I do not
 recommend you use them at the start.

 Finding content as a beginner can be difficult, particularly for
 languages that are not as popular. If you’re starved for interesting
 content or just want to, feel free to try something outside of the
 typical beginner range—you can still learn with it.

 **Good sources of beginner content**

 | **Source**       | **Description**    |

 | [Gloss](https://gloss.dliflc.edu/) | Website with a lot of beginner content |
 | [The Fable Cottage](https://www.thefablecottage.com/) | Dual-language fairy tales |

 You can also use other learner’s guides online to find good input.

 **Key tip: Use a variety of different content**
 \
 Make sure your content has a lot of variety in terms of the context and
 skills it uses. It is surprisingly difficult to translate your language
 ability from one skill into another without a lot of practice. For
 example, reading lots will help you learn a lot of words, but you will
 struggle to recognise these words when you hear them until you’ve done a
 lot of listening practice. One good heuristic is to look for content
 that contains at least some audio and some written. Starting with audio
 early will help your communication in the long run. In addition, using a range of resources will give you exposure to
 different vocabulary, accents, and degrees of formality that will help your overall ability.

# Other resources


## Language exchange resources

 Later in your learning, it will be useful to find ways to practise your
 language with others. These resources will help you find partners.

## Dictionaries

 The best dictionary to use depends on your language. Not all are listed
 here. The ideal dictionary will give you example sentences, an English
 equivalent, and the correct pronunciation.

 Here are a few dictionaries that offer translations for multiple
 languages:

## Translators

 Translation software can help you understand entire sentences. Avoid
 becoming over-reliant on translating whole sentences. Try to understand
 a sentence yourself first.

## Phrasebooks

 Phrasebooks are optional, but phrases can help you get a feel for the
 language and greatly improve your communicative ability when travelling.
 A cautionary note: phrases cannot be learned simply by reading them.
 Learning needs to be supplemented with flashcards.

 **Key tip: Use resources you enjoy**
 \
 Studying languages is not always the most exciting activity, so choosing
 resources that you enjoy helps a lot. Keep in mind that there is plenty
 of room for individual preference for resources when it comes to what is
 the most effective way to learn. Use what you like and don’t worry too
 much about what others recommend. If you find yourself getting bored
 with a resource, feel free to change it.

Resources are worth very little on their own. Next we will cover how to use your resources together by building a method.
