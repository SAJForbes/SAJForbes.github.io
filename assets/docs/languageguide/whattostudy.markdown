In this chapter I am aiming to give you a framework to decide what activities to do. You may notice you already do a lot of what is here. The purpose is to help you understand what is happening beneath the hood and use that knowledge to do it better.

# Goals and weaknesses

Two fundamental factors weigh on your choice of what to study:

1.  Your goals

2.  Your weaknesses

## Your goals

The best activities for study either closely simulate or match your
goals. For example, if you are learning a language for its literature,
reading a book is a perfect exercise. If your goal is to have
conversations, your focus should be on listening and speaking
activities.

**Narrow your learning**
\
If you have a specific context you want to be highly competent in, such
as work or family, your choice of input and vocabulary can differ from a
more evenly balanced approach. Narrowing your learning allows you to
effectively reach a higher level much faster and can be more enjoyable.
Start by tailoring the resources you use and using content that aligns
with the contexts you need the language for. For example, if you want to
learn for business purposes, interviews (podcasts or videos) of experts
and articles in business publications are more useful. Your goal may
emphasise certain skills, and this same idea applies. For example, if
you want to be able to communicate with ordinary people in public, you
should utilise audio resources and speaking practice more.

## Your weaknesses

A weakness is anything that prevents you successfully completing your
goal. Based on your experience engaging with your goals, try to decide
what is most holding you back. For example, if you can read but struggle
to watch TV shows without subtitles, you may need to work on your aural
comprehension.

If you’re not sure, it’s a good bet your vocabulary is holding you back
at least somewhat. A fluent speaker of English knows over 10,000 words,
and you’re probably not there yet.

Once you’ve identified a weakness, choose resources and do activities
that let you improve that aspect or skill you are lacking in. For
example, you may choose podcasts because you struggle to understand
spoken language, or you may pick some written content that interests you
to help you learn words.

### What do I need to know?

To help you think about your weaknesses, here is a list of things you
can aim to improve. This list is not comprehensive. What is most
important will depend on your goals and target language.

**Potential weaknesses to focus on**

| **Core component or skill** | **Aspect**                                          |
|:----------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| Grammar                     | Function of verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs <br /> Tense  <br /> Mood  <br /> Number <br /> Gender <br /> Word order  <br /> Suffixes <br /> Other grammar (language-dependent)                  |
| Vocabulary                  | Number of words known <br /> Prepositions and other particles  <br /> Collocations <br /> Common phrases <br /> Numbers                                             |
| Reading                     | Orthography <br /> Characters (for languages like Chinese or Japanese) |
| Listening                   | Sound perception <br /> Distinguishing words <br /> Speed of comprehension                              |
| Speaking                    | Phonetics <br /> Tone <br /> Intonation <br /> Fluidity and pace                                   |
| Writing                     | Spelling <br /> Writing speed                                       |





# Practising and Drilling

Now we will look at the kinds of exercises you can do plus how to think about which ones to choose.

Earlier in this guide we covered two essential components of a good
method: *practice* and *drill*. These are the two fundamental types of
study. Everything you do is either one or the other or a mix.

## Practice


**Practising** is using the language for your goal in an integrated fashion. Practice blends and hones the skills and knowledge you already have with less focus on gaining new knowledge. These are the meaning-focused activities coming up in the next section.

Practising helps you learn new forms and words in two key ways:

-   **Exposure**—By encountering forms and words in context
    repeatedly over time, you will eventually come to remember them and
    understand how they are used (comprehensible input).

-   **Language output**—Speaking and writing your language will
    reinforce your knowledge and help you get feedback.

It is often best to directly practise the thing you want to get better
at. For example, if you want to improve at conversation, then talk with
native speakers. If you find your main goal too difficult, you can do
similar tasks, such as listening to podcasts or speaking aloud in a
mirror, if necessary.

You may often find yourself doing other forms of practice that are not
your goal. There can be good reasons for this:

-   You may not be able to practise your goal

-   You may want some variety in your learning

-   You may need something a bit easier in order to improve on your
    weaknesses—For example, you may read because you are frequently
    missing grammatical forms in conversation

This type of indirect practice can be useful; however, it is usually
slower at helping you achieve your goals. **As much as possible, your
practice should be direct**.

Learners often substitute direct practice with a related task when they
shouldn’t. Those who want to communicate will pass time drilling
grammar, vocabulary, or reading news. These tasks have their place but
will not result in progress without a lot of direct practice.

**Principle: Noticing**
\
A great way to passively pick up grammar and vocabulary is by simply
noticing. That means noticing words and constructions you have had
explained to you before and recalling their function and meaning while
using content. As you engage with your content, previously unknown forms
gradually will become clear to you.
\
Keep an eye out for new unknown forms or words as you read. Noticing
something, becoming curious, searching for a word, and learning its
meaning is a very powerful way to learn. Looking things up every time is
usually not practical. Instead, try to be aware so that you can spot
common forms, eventually looking them up once you encounter them enough
that you have an idea of how they are used.

## Drill

**Drilling** is the act of trying to improve a specific component of language by doing an activity that only focuses on that. Usually this is something that is too difficult to focus on when you are trying to practise. Drill is about isolating and improving on individual weaknesses without worrying as much about how they fit in the broader language. These are the language-focused and fluency-focused activities coming up in the next section.

Here are some things that are considered drills:

-   **Direct explanation**—This is when you use a resource that directly explains how the language works. It is a very common component of your beginner course. 

-   **Flashcards**

-   **Grammar exercises**

-   **Looking up words**—Usually this will be part of a larger drill that uses content


Drilling works by reducing your cognitive load, which lets you focus on a single thing and improve at a faster rate than you otherwise would have. Drills don’t have to be simple rote-learning activities. In fact, some drills are far superior to others. When you do a drill exercise, you should assess if it is truly helping you.

A good drill exercise:

-   uses real language as much as possible, such as the content you use

-   simulates the part of the real-life situation you are looking to
    improve in

-   is relevant to the weaknesses currently preventing you from
    achieving your goals

-   focuses on building skills or knowledge crucial to understanding

A bad drill would:

-   be irrelevant to the content you are using

-   be irrelevant to your goals or weaknesses

-   focus on aspects of the language that you will come to acquire
    through input anyway and that do not prevent you from understanding
    your content

It is also recommended to avoid drilling too much. A lot of the skills
learners choose to drill will be developed over time with input anyway.

**Principle: 80 percent of your results come from 20 percent of your study**
\
Otherwise known as the [Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle), this
principle is applied to basically every field out there and has its
origins in management theory. This principle is not a fundamental law,
but the observation that the fastest progress can be made by focusing on
a certain subset of issues that are having the largest impact on
performance.
\
Applying it to language learning, the principle states that for any
domain of your target language, fixing the biggest 20% of your issues
will achieve 80% of the impact you can get in that domain. Similarly,
20% of your study time is probably achieving 80% of your results. Some
activities you are doing are probably having a minimal impact, while
some smaller gaps in your knowledge are probably having an outsized
impact on your ability to communicate. Think about what activities seem
to give you the biggest improvements and re-assess your study routine.
{: .notice--info}

## Practise then drill

Skills gained during drills do not easily transfer to other situations.
Just because you spend lots of time drilling grammar, that does not mean
you will find yourself effortlessly employing it when you next speak. This gives rise to the next principle:

**Principle: Practise then drill**
\
In order to improve, it is best to practise then drill the weaknesses you identify are holding you back. Follow up by attempting to practise your goal again, consciously employing the new knowledge you have gained from your drills.
{: .notice--info}

Real-world skill at language (or any task) is a complex melding of its
constituent skills that involves novel scenarios and unpredictability
that drills can struggle to simulate. This is why basic workbook grammar
exercises are not a recommended drill. You’ll get very good at doing
tests, but what portion of that will easily transfer to your speaking?
Not so much.

Balance drill and practice. Both will help you improve, but each has strengths and weaknesses that play off each other.
Excessive study without practice will not translate into skills that
help you achieve your goals. Excessive practice without study could
cause you to develop fossilised errors (this often often occurs with
people who speak a lot) or cause your rate of improvement to stagnate.



# Language Learning Activities

Now that you have a good understanding of what a good exercise for you looks like, it's time to look at some possible activities for you to do. You can use this section to get ideas.

All activities fall into one of three categories:

1.  **Meaning-focused**

2.  **Language-focused**

3.  **Fluency-focused**

Each falls into a niche that helps you apprehend your language.

How much you do of each is up to you, though the nature of
meaning-focused language learning activities means they will likely take
most of your time.

Next we will look at what these categories are and some activities for
you to consider doing. You don’t have to do every activity; in fact,
people commonly get away with doing only a few.

## Meaning-focused activities

Large amounts of natural language are required to learn a language, so
the learner should be seeking out and engaging with large amounts of
input. The goal is simply to expose yourself to as much of the language
as possible and generally understand what is happening. It will be
helpful to become comfortable with an incomplete understanding of what
you read or hear.

**Meaning-focused activities**

| **Activity**                | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|:----------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Extensive reading**       | Already mentioned earlier. Reading as much as possible and on a wide range of subjects. The goal is to be exposed to as much vocabulary as possible while still understanding what you read, even if not fully.                                                                                                                                        |
| **Narrow reading**          | Staying within a specific topic area when reading can help you encounter many of the same words over and over to improve your vocabulary retention. It can also help you target the kind of vocabulary you learn. You can achieve this by following the same topic in the news or reading about a specialist area of knowledge you already know about. |
| **Conversation practice**   | Already mentioned earlier. Talking and listening to native speakers in real conversation is highly beneficial.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **Reading while listening** | Helps you get used to sounds while reading, as well as improving comprehension over simply listening.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Listening to audio**      | This works like extensive and narrow reading, but by listening to podcasts or radio. This can be harder since listening is a more difficult skill to master.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **Read and write**          | Try reading and then writing a short article about a topic. If you want to mix it up, you don’t have to read, but can instead watch or listen and write.                                                                                                                                                                                               |



## Language-focused activities


This is when you utilise some smaller piece of content to attempt
focused improvement at a specific component or skill, such as a grammar
concept, vocabulary, natural phrases, or aural comprehension. This is
the closest to a typical desk study session. Resources used for
language-focused learning are often more difficult than those you would
use for meaning-focused learning.

**Language-focused activities**

| **Activity**                                       | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|:---------------------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Intensive reading**                              | Drilling with content. This means carefully reading a specific text with the objective of learning a new piece of language. Your goal is to understand the text by repeatedly reading it and consciously choosing what you will focus on.                                                                                                            |
| **Memorising sentences or words using flashcards** | This technique is well covered in the sections on flashcards.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| **Writing new forms and words down**               | Self-explanatory. Many people find the act of writing to be helpful for memorisation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Translating between languages**                  | If you have a dual-language text, you might try to translate your native into your target language, then compare your translation to the actual text.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **Delayed copying**                                | Using a rather small text (approx. 200 words), read it first to understand it, then follow up by going through, trying to remember the first four or five words and writing them on a piece of paper without referring back to the text. You can gradually increase the number of words. This helps you hold longer and longer phrases in your head. |
| **Writing practice**                               | Write something and send it to a native to be corrected. Optionally, write a follow-up text integrating what you have learned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |



## Fluency-focused activities


These are exercises aimed at helping you improve the speed and ease at
which you can use language you already know, focusing on the four
skills. If you use content, you will generally use it for some specific
component and focus only on that. Typical fluency-focused activities
involve pronunciation.

**Fluency-focused activities**

| **Activity**             | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|:-------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Listening for sounds** | Focusing on sounds rather than meaning to hear how words sound in connected speech.                                                                                                                  |
| **Shadowing**            | Listening to dialogues with text and trying to mimic the speakers as closely as possible. After a few repetitions you can try to speak over top of them. Helps work on intonation and pronunciation. |
| **Repeated writing**     | Writing, getting it checked and corrected, looking at it carefully, putting it away, and then writing it again from memory.                                                                          |
| **Repeated speaking**    | Record yourself speaking a text and play it back, listen and compare to a native.                                                                                                                    |



**Key tip: Make sure you get some variety**
\
Try to do study involving at least one activity from each of the three categories. In addition, it will help to include a little bit of each of the four skills. A bit of everything will allow each skill to build on the other. For example, reading a lot will help your speaking, but even speaking every now and then will aid your reading by making words and concepts more salient in your mind.
