A method is the combination of resources and exercises you use to learn a language combined with how you schedule your learning. As a beginner, your goal is to build the skills you need to reach an intermediate level as outlined in [What you will learn](\assets\docs\languageguide\beforeyoustart\#what-you-will-learn) as fast as possible. Methods can be simple or complex, but regardless of how much effort you put into it, you will need one.

In this chapter I will provide an overview of how to build a method of your own.

# The four keys of an effective method

Unfortunately, there is no single best language method.[^3] There are
many highly effective methods and the specifics are not hugely
important. Individual preference and interest will play a strong role in
what works for you. Because of this, there is a lot of flexibility to
how you build your method, meaning I can only give you general advice.
To do that, this section distils the elements common to all good methods
into four key requirements. These are:

1.  Structure

2.  Drills

3.  Practice

4.  Balance

[^3]: If you’re wondering how some people become conversational in a large number of languages, check out the discussion in [Why do some people seem to know lots of languages?](\assets\docs\languageguide\appendixe\#why-do-some-people-seem-to-know-lots-of-languages)

## Structure

Structuring your learning means you begin with the most basic component
of your language that helps you improve the most.

**Principle: Build a base and work up**
\
Languages are best learned by starting from simple concepts and words
and building towards more complicated ones as you improve, focusing on
the components that help you improve the most. Without a base level of
understanding, it will be harder to understand more advanced concepts or
comprehend content that uses them.
\
Focus on learning the simplest thing you need to improve to get you
towards your goal. You will find you progress much faster.

Learn the most basic words and grammar first as a base, then
gradually improve by moving to more complex words and grammar as you
improve. The same applies to the four skills. This means there is a
natural order to the knowledge you acquire in language learning. Courses are highly recommended in part because they provide all the
structure you need to build a comprehensive foundation in the language.



## Drills

A drill is an exercise that isolates a single aspect of your language so
that you can develop it separately from the others. This includes
learning vocabulary with flashcards, practising pronunciation, or
reading about the grammar. Beginner textbooks are generally full of
drills. Your method should incorporate extra drills where you have
weaknesses, often caused by your course neglecting certain aspects of
your language.

The two key drills you will use are:

-   Drill with flashcards—covered later [here](\assets\docs\languageguide\usingresourceseffectively\#using-flashcards-effectively)

-   Drill with content—covered later [here](\assets\docs\languageguide\keyactivities\#drill-your-language-using-content)

We will look at a larger list of drills later [here](\assets\docs\languageguide\whattostudy/).

## Practice

Practising your language integrates everything you have learned
together. Examples include speaking with people, writing texts, or
reading stories. It is mostly absent from the beginner stages, but will
gradually take a larger role as you progress. Without practice, all of
the knowledge and skills you build through your study will not translate
into real-world language ability.

The key types of practice are:

-   Input: reading or listening using content

-   Output: speaking or writing your language

Input helps you understand how the language goes together and repeatedly
exposes you to essential words and forms. A helpful activity, extensive reading, will be covered later [here](\assets\docs\languageguide/keyactivities\#extensive-reading) with more advice [here](\assets\docs\languageguide\usingresourceseffectively\#using-input-effectively).

Output is a great activity you might like to start early that helps
solidify your knowledge and get feedback on your weaknesses. Output is
harder to benefit from at a very low level, so can be left out of the
beginner stage. A great activity, conversation practice, will be covered later [here](\assets\docs\languageguide\keyactivities/#conversation-practice).

## Balance

This means you have an appropriate balance of vocabulary, grammar, and
the four skills. Similarly, avoid spending too much time on drills or too much time on practice. A bit of everything you need will serve you
best.

Hopefully you are already convinced of the need for grammar and
vocabulary study in your learning. It is important to maintain a balance
between these two. Avoid spending all your time on one or the other.

In addition, you need to be focusing on building the skills to necessary to read, write, listen, or speak, depending on what your goal is. Actively use these skills as a part of your method. If any of the four skills are required for you to achieve your goals but are not well-covered by your beginner course, you should seek to learn them separately. More advice on learning the four skills will be given later [here](\assets\docs\languageguide\howtolearn/#the-four-skills).

**Principle: Work towards your goals**
\
One of the best things you can do for your progress is to focus on your
goals and the skills you need to get there. Unfortunately, the
individual skills improved by studying do not easily translate into your
target situation. Usually, the best way to do that is through *direct
practice*, spending time directly practising the thing you want to
become good at.[^4] For example, if you want to converse face-to-face,
you need to spend a large amount of time practising speaking and
listening, ideally in communication with others.

# How you progress

Your method can be split into two phases: the **starting phase** and the
**input phase**.

The **starting phase** is where you focus on building the skills
necessary to begin using input to learn your language. In this phase,
your level is too low to understand much content, so you first need to
drill basic grammar and vocabulary to create a base for yourself. There
is nothing stopping you using content here; you’d simply have to spend
most of your time with a dictionary and grammar resource, which is not
particularly efficient or fun.

[//]: <> (para removed)

The **input phase** comes next. This is the rest of your study. Once you
have the basics down, you can take advantage of that base to begin
learning with content.

There is no concrete point where you exit one phase and begin the next.
These phases blend as you gradually build the knowledge you need to use more
natural content.

[//]: <> (para shortened)

These two phases mean your progress should follow a natural progression of skills as you improve. There is some variation, but a typical order looks something like this:

1.  Learn the writing system (if necessary)

2.  Learn the most common 500–1,000 words

3.  Learn some basic grammar, often at the same time as the first words

4.  Begin trying to read some basic sentences

5.  Gradually learn more complex grammar and vocabulary

6.  Begin using learner-centred content to practise

7.  Learn the skills required for speaking and listening

8.  Gradually integrate your grammar and vocabulary knowledge into
    listening

9.  Begin speaking as you continue to learn more vocabulary and grammar

10. Transition away from beginner-centred content to intermediate
    materials

11. Transition to content intended for native speakers

# Building your method

There are thousands of possible methods, but a very common and effective way of achieving the above progression is by studying with the resources outlined previously. This is why those particular resources were highlighted to you. Here is an extremely common method:

-   Learn grammar and some vocabulary by progressing through your course

-   Learn the skills you need for your goal through your beginner course
    or a supplementary resource if necessary

-   Drill and reinforce your knowledge of grammar and vocabulary with
    flashcards

-   Practise by reading and/or listening as much as you can using
    beginner input

There are lots other ways to structure your method while following the four
key requirements. For example, you could forego courses in favour of
reading lots, looking up concepts as necessary. You could drill by using
a vocabulary list or writing sentences instead of flashcards.[^5] You
could get input mostly just by practising speaking with a friend or
tutor.

[^5]: While there are learners that do this, I don't recommend you go without using flashcards, drills, or courses until you are a more experienced learner and better understand what works for you.

## Using other learners’ methods

I recommend you find some ideas for your method while you search for
resources. There are plenty of places on the internet where people have
detailed their own method. You can often find these with a simple Google
search along the lines of “How to learn Japanese”. Take the useful bits
of other people’s methods you find. Remember: the specifics of any
method aren’t the key, so don’t stress about following someone’s method
exactly.

Using others’ methods is useful for two reasons. First, they will often
give good resource recommendations and advice on integrating them into
your method, which I can’t give you here. Second, you will often find
good advice on your specific language, such as common beginner pitfalls
or useful areas to focus your attention.

Beware: Common learner advice often fails to account for learner goals,
and some exercises may be poorly optimised for your goals. For example,
if you learn Chinese, you may be recommended to learn the Hanzi
(characters) by writing them out repeatedly. This is very effective at
enabling you to write and use a few Hanzi very well. It is also very
time-consuming. However, if you goal is to speak or read lots of
content, this could be a misuse of your time. That same amount of time
could be spent learning to recognise even more Hanzi or practising
pronunciation. Remember the principle *Build a base and work up*? If, later on, you want to master writing, you will find the task much easier with a strong base from your reading.

**Principle: Push yourself**
\
During your study, you will inevitably find certain resources or content eventually
become easy for you. The key to a good method is that you move on as
soon as you begin to feel to comfortable with a resource. There will
always be something more challenging for you to try. By continually
challenging yourself, you will be constantly pushed to improve.

## Splitting your time



There’s no single guideline for how to split your time. At the beginner
stages, it is common for learners to spend fully half or more of their
time with their preferred beginner course, with the other half spent
drilling and practising in equal measure. Later on, time with the course
tends to reduce and practice tends to become more frequent. Do what
works for you. The key is that you progress and improve.

You will need to adjust how you spend your time based on the nature of
the course you are using. For example, if your course uses little
content and focuses on exercises, you have a greater need to supplement
your learning with content.

Your most important time is that which you spend with content—it is
crucial to progressing in your language. Many learners spend up to 75%
of their time practising with input. Apart from at the very beginning,
avoid reducing your time below one third. Progress through input can be
hard to notice in the short-term, but is invaluable long-term.

# Your study routine

Now that we’ve discussed what to do with your time, we turn to the topic of building a routine.

There are four components:

1. How much time to spend
2. When to spend your time
3. Integrating your language into your life
3. Staying motivated

## How much time to spend

The simple fact is: the more time you spend learning, the better. Languages require a certain number of hours to achieve a high level at, and you cannot cheat your way out of this requirement.

**Principle: Spend as much time as you can with your language**
\
The key factor determining how fast you learn your language is **time**. If you want to improve quickly, aim to spend as much time as possible learning. It is far more important than having the perfect technique or using the perfect resource.
{: .notice--info}

To help build your time with the language, it is important to study every day. Ideally, **commit to study at least an hour** per day. There is no
maximum—the more you can commit each day, the faster you will progress.

## When to spend your time

The best technique is to build a routine. To do this, have a set time
each day you devote to study without any pauses or distractions. It
helps if a block deals with a single resource, such as an article,
course lesson, workbook chapter, or podcast episode.

It also helps to intersperse your learning. As long as you are doing a
block of at least 20 minutes, then the rest of your learning can be
interspersed throughout the day. Similarly, try to study consistently
every day rather than doing it all at the end of the week.

There are lots of clever ways to help you spend more time than you
otherwise would. We will look at these next.

## Integrating your language into your life

Think of learning language as something that becomes a part of your life
rather than something to set time for like a school subject. This
enables you to spend far more time with the language than you otherwise
would have. Here are some ways you can do this:

-   Spread your learning out throughout the day rather than segmenting a
    single large block of time

-   Switch the language of the media you consume

-   Try to find a friend or group of friends that speak your target
    language

-   Change the language of the devices you use

-   Once you are good enough, try to think in your target language

A big advantage of the modern world is you can easily take your study
materials and content with you wherever you go. To do some extra
learning, you can use the small bits of downtime throughout your day,
such as on the bus, in a queue, or walking between class. Here are a few
ideas:

-   Get a penpal on a chat app such those listed in the ; use any
    downtime to read and send messages

-   Use digital flashcards on your phone

-   Use a beginner course that has an app

-   Listen to podcasts while cooking, cleaning, walking, or during any
    activity where you don’t have to carefully focus

-   Carry a book with you

## Staying motivated

**Principle: Keep up your motivation**
\
Maintaining motivation is key to succeeding at your language learning
goals. Staying motivated is important because it will cause you to study
more frequently, help you study longer, and reduce the chances you will
give up. Becoming unmotivated can lead to stagnation as you find it
difficult to sit and study for the required length of time. Pay
attention to your motivation and focus on doing activities you know keep
you motivated and interested.
{: .notice--info}

Here are some ideas to help you keep your motivation high:

-   **Use resources you enjoy**—Try different methods and choose one
    that you enjoy the most. This will take the edge off the study
    process. Read more in the key tip .

-   **Use content you find interesting**—There’s lots of interesting
    content out there. You will find yourself enjoying learning your
    language a lot more when you find content you enjoy for its own
    sake.

-   **Work towards your goals**—Striving towards your goals, making
    progress, and successfully engaging with those parts of the language
    can be a motivating experience. It can be helpful to keep your goals
    around you. For example, hanging around with speakers of the
    language you are learning.

-   **Refresh**—If you feel yourself stagnating, try changing your
    routine by studying at a different time, studying in a different
    place, doing exercises you wouldn’t usually do, or using content you
    don’t usually use.

# Summary of the book so far

Before we move on, it will be helpful to review what we have covered.

Find a goal and build a method. Ensure you include the four keys:
structure, drills, practice, and balance. You can use a basic method at
the start, but there are plenty of ideas you can get from others. How
you split your time is up to you, but be sure that content retains an
important position. Spend at least 20 minutes a day in focused study.
Increase your time with the language by integrating it into your life.
Keep up your motivation by choosing resources that you enjoy using.

# Moving forward

You are now in a good position to start studying. All you need to do is
begin searching for resources, then build your own method and you are
ready to start. From here, we will be looking at how to do your method
better. I will start with a section on using the core resources
effectively. I will then move to learning effectively. I finish the core
portion of the guide with a set of three key activities that are great
for any learner from upper-beginner onwards. If you have time, I
recommend you continue to read after this chapter.
