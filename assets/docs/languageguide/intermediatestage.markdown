This chapter marks the end of the advice tailored towards beginners. From here, I provide more frameworks to help intermediate learners choose better study activities and progress more effectively. If you've gotten this far and have yet to begin your journey, **I recommend you stop here and begin studying**. There is nothing here that will change how you should approach your learning as a beginner.

# How your study changes

The intermediate stage is where the learner largely ceases to follow a
structured syllabus. Your beginner course will either have finished or
moved on to advanced grammar. At this point, learning becomes more
self-directed based on your goals.

The study routine of an intermediate learner is quite different to that
of a beginner:

-   There is less structured learning of grammar

-   Writing and speaking will start to feature much more prominently

-   Choosing what to study next is your choice

-   A lot of interesting content opens up as understanding increases

-   Learning becomes more goal-directed

Nearly everything you do will be centred around content. There is a huge
amount of nuance to grammar and vocabulary usage, so the only way to
properly absorb it all is with content.

# Slowing progress

The intermediate stages also mark the point in which you will begin to feel like your progress is slowing down, a phenomenon commonly referred to as the *intermediate plateau*. This is a natural part of your learning, and leads us to the next principle I want to share with you:

**Principle: Trust the process**
\
A common learner complaint is that learning seems to slow down at a
certain point. This can lead to frustration at a seeming lack of
progress. These natural plateaus will occur often in your learning. This
happens to everyone. It is a natural part of learning a language and has
more to do with how language learning works than anything to do with
you. The best fix is to simply power through it. Continue using input,
challenge yourself to improve, and, most importantly, **trust the
process**. You will progress, I promise. Read the r/languagelearning FAQ
entry [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/languagelearning/wiki/faq#wiki_my_progress_is_much_slower_than_it_should_be_.2F_my_learning_is_slowing_down) for more info.

There is no point where your learning will appear to pick back up to the pace you experienced as a beginner, though you can continue to tangibly improve faster with good application of the advice here. To help you through this stage, the next chapter will discuss the kinds of exercises you can do and how to choose between them.
