      <description>Why do children seem to have a natural ability to learn languages perfectly that adults lack? Are their brains inherently better at language learning than us adults, or are they better positioned to take advantage of a natural ability we all possess?
Wherever you fall, most people tend to say the answer is something in-between.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to argue that it&amp;rsquo;s their environment rather than innate talent that lets children learn to such a high level, and we can take advantage of this to inform how we learn.</description>
