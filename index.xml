      <description>Welcome to this analysis of the /r/languagelearning subreddit survey data. Before I begin I should mention a bit about myself. In addition to my role as the moderator of the /r/languagelearning subreddit on reddit, I am also the author of the ebook How to Teach Yourself a Foreign Language, which is available for free on my website. I am also a data analyst in my real life.
The survey was taken on September/October 2019 by the users of the /r/LanguageLearning subreddit.</description>

      <description>Language learning takes a long time, usually much longer than any learner anticipates when they begin. At first, it seems pretty easy. Most people start with a bang, putting in the hours and achieving a basic ability in a few months. From there, everything seems to slow down. Suddenly, improving takes forever, and many people quit after months of no appreciable improvement. What’s going on? Do we just lack the ability to learn one language for a long period of time?</description>

      <title>Why Adults Make Mistakes When Children Don&#39;t</title>

      <description>Why do children seem to have a natural ability to learn languages perfectly that adults lack? Are their brains inherently better at language learning than us adults, or are they better positioned to take advantage of a natural ability we all possess?
Wherever you fall, most people tend to say the answer is something in-between.
In this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to argue that it&amp;rsquo;s their environment rather than innate talent that lets children learn to such a high level, and we can take advantage of this to inform how we learn.</description>
