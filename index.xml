      <description>Let me introduce you to an often-posed question in the language learning community: Why do children seem to have a natural ability to learn languages perfectly that adults lack? Are their brains inherently better at language learning than us adults, or are they better positioned to take advantage of a natural ability we all possess?
Wherever you fall, most people tend to say the answer is something in-between.
While I can&amp;rsquo;t discount that children have some natural advantages due to their age, in this post I&amp;rsquo;m going to argue that it&amp;rsquo;s their environment rather than innate talent that lets children learn to such a high level, and we can take advantage of this to inform how we learn.</description>
